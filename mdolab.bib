This paper deals with a new way of computing {\$}{\$}q{\$}{\$}-EI, without using Monte-Carlo simulations, through a closed-form formula. The latter allows a very fast computation of {\$}{\$}q{\$}{\$}-EI for reasonably low values of {\$}{\$}q{\$}{\$}(typically, less than 10). New parallel kriging-based optimization strategies, tested on different toy examples, show promising results.}

    abstract    = {Optimal nacelle placement is critical to commercial or transport aircraft designs that use engines mounted with nacelles. Over-wing nacelle (OWN) configuration has a high potential to improve upon the conventional under-wing nacelle (UWN) configuration. OWN configurations have two critical benefits when compared to the conventional UWN configuration: 1. they ease the integration of high BPR and ultra-high BPR engines by alleviating ground clearance issues, and 2. they provide a significant amount of noise reduction because the wing blocks the noise of the fan and the jet. Despite their advantages, the OWN technology is not used in practical aircraft designs due to the difficulties in the aeropropulsive integration of the propulsion system. In this work, we propose using a coupled aeropropulsive design optimization framework to study the aeropropulsive integration for OWN configurations. The coupling behavior between the aerodynamics of the wing and the propulsion
                  system is extremely important. Especially in OWN configurations, the propulsion system is highly influenced by the aerodynamic performance of the wing. In this paper, we address the design problem of coupling between the aerodynamic and the propulsion system. We also explore wide range of design space to achieve the best practical design. The changes in wing shape are insignificant when the OWN configuration is optimized for different FPR. Wing in OWN performs better when the propulsor is close to the wing's root; however, the overall drag increases when the propulsor is close to the root. This increases the shaft power need. In addition, nacelle placement at the aft of the trailing edge shows better performance than forward of the trailing edge of the wing. These advancements in design optimization capabilities will be critical in the future design of OWN configurations to achieve more environmentally sustainable aircraft designs.}

Despite their benefits, OWN technology is not widely used in real aircraft designs because of the challenges and lack of research in aeropropulsive integration of the propulsion system. In this work, we present multipoint aeropropulsive design optimizations of an OWN configuration to address several scenarios. To effectively design the propulsor in OWN, we consider on-design and off-design formulations of engine design concepts. In this work, we present one single-point optimization and three multipoint optimizations. In the multipoint optimizations, the objective is to minimize the shaft power at cruise conditions subject to
                  constraints. To compare the performance degradation of single-point optimization, we performed several sub-optimizations to reflect the multipoint cases. The single-point optimal design required additional 0.4\% shaft power across the cruise conditions when compared to the multipoint optimization with 3 cruise points. In addition, distortion-constrained and distortion-unconstrained optimizations were performed at the take-off scenario. By modifying the inlet shape of the nacelle, the distortion-constrained optimization effectively reduces the distortion in the take-off scenario at the outermost radial ring over the fan by penalizing the cruise performance. The multipoint optimizations in this work highlight a number of significant design effects. An effective design is produced by including the required flight conditions and specifying the proper objective and constraints in the OWN multipoint problem. These design optimization capabilities will be crucial in
                  determining the viability of novel propulsion concepts for next-generation OWN aircraft.}

In this situation, heuristic algorithms become an executable choice when facing this kind of problems. In this paper, we introduce the complex system which is more complicated than normal multi-objectives and multi-constraints problems. For each family of systems, the objective functions and constraints are normally shared among families. Since keeping the certain number of objective functions and constraints for the entire population is no longer a realistic situation in today's industry, it is time to find a new algorithm to deal with complex system. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is a newly developed heuristic algorithm, and with the promising and consistent performance in [1], [2] and [3], it becomes a strong competitor in this area. In this paper, BBO will be applied to the complex system families for the

For an appropriate combination of terms and appropriate choice of the step size in real and imaginary direction, 4 t h order accuracy can be achieved in a very simple and efficient scheme on a compact stencil. New different ways of computing second order derivatives in one single step are shown. Many of the first order derivative approximations avoid the problem of subtractive cancellation inherent to the classic finite difference approximations for real valued steps, and the superior accuracy and stability of the generalized Complex Step approximations is demonstrated for an analytic test function.}

This is accurate enough for long missions where the majority of time is spent near a single flight condition in cruise. But for regional and narrowbody aircraft, the fuel burn in climb is a substantial portion of the block fuel burn---traditional methods do not account for this. This work introduces a new approach: mission-based optimization. This approach gives the optimizer detailed information throughout the mission so the optimizer can optimally trade off performance at different flight conditions. The mission is computed by numerically integrating states such as fuel burn across this mission, satisfying force balance at each integration point, and using a physics-based turbofan model.}

    abstract    = {Electrified aircraft propulsion enables new aircraft designs with fewer emissions. One challenge of electrified architectures is handling the electrical components&rsquo; waste heat. This is because batteries and other electrical components are sensitive to high temperatures and accumulate heat within their structure. In this work, we investigate using a thermoacoustic refrigerator to cool the battery of a parallel hybrid single-aisle commercial transport aircraft. This thermoacoustic refrigeration system is powered by waste heat from the turbofan engine core, whereas a conventional refrigerator consumes electricity from the battery or shaft power offtakes. Compared to a conventional vapor cycle refrigerator, the thermoacoustic refrigeration system results in greater mission fuel burn because of pressure losses attributable to the extraction of heat from the turbofan to drive the thermoacoustic refrigerator. Heat exchangers with very low pressure losses may render
                  the thermoacoustic refrigeration system beneficial compared to conventional refrigeration in certain use cases, such as low-altitude missions.}

    abstract    = {As the computational resources available to aerodynamicists increase, so does the number of tools with which they can analyze their designs. The key skill of a good engineer is understanding when each tool produces realistic results. Even if no available tool can capture all relevant physical phenomena, this knowledge allows engineers to alter their designs to account for the missing physics. However, with the increasing use of numerical optimization for aerodynamic shape design, the opportunity for this intuition to shape the design is reduced as the optimizer makes design decisions based purely on numerical results. This makes the choice of analysis method critical. Previous studies have compared panel-based aerodynamic tools and RANS CFD to predict and analyze the key aerodynamic phenomena in different flight conditions. But few, if any, have compared the impact of proper tool selection on the optimal aerodynamic shapes. In this work we show the effect of
                  aerodynamic analysis method selection on the optimal aerodynamic shape and the consequences of choosing one that does not capture the relevant flow physics. In particular, we show that modelling boundary layer transition can produce significantly lower drag designs across almost the entire range of Reynolds numbers at which airfoils are used in practice. Additionally, we find that the simple compressibility correction used in XFOIL is sufficient to produce well performing airfoils for flight Mach numbers up to 0.65, after which point the ability for the flow solver to model shock formation is critical. Our results will provide aerodynamicists with the data and intuition to make informed decisions when selecting analysis methods for optimization.}

To maintain these benefits while meeting environmental goals, next-generation aircraft must have drastically reduced climate impacts. Hydrogen-powered aircraft have the potential to fly existing routes with no carbon emissions and reduce or eliminate other emissions. This paper is a comprehensive guide to hydrogen-powered aircraft that explains the fundamental physics and reviews current technologies. We discuss the impact of these technologies on aircraft design, cost, certification, and environment. In the long term, hydrogen aircraft appear to be the most compelling alternative to today's kerosene-powered aircraft. Using hydrogen also enables novel technologies, such as fuel cells and superconducting electronics, which could lead to aircraft concepts that are not feasible with kerosene. Hydrogen-powered aircraft are technologically feasible but
                  require significant research and development. Lightweight liquid hydrogen tanks and their integration with the airframe is one of the critical technologies. Fuel cells can eliminate in-flight emissions but must become lighter, more powerful, and more durable to make large, fuel cell-powered transport aircraft feasible. Hydrogen turbofans already have these desirable characteristics but produce some emissions, albeit much less damaging than kerosene turbofans. Beyond airframe and propulsion technologies, the viability of hydrogen aircraft hinges on low-cost green hydrogen production, which requires massive investments in the energy infrastructure.}

Companies and researchers have suggested that the blended wing body configuration is well-suited to hydrogen because it can efficiently store the large fuel tanks. However, nobody has quantified this claim, at least publicly. We address this gap by comparing optimized kerosene and hydrogen versions of blended wing body and tube and wing aircraft. We find that the blended wing body configuration has only a small advantage for onboard hydrogen storage compared to a conventional tube and wing aircraft. Our models predict that with ambitious hydrogen tank technology assumptions, a hydrogen blended wing body uses 3.1\% more energy than a kerosene blended wing body, while the energy increase for a
                  tube and wing is 5.1\%. An advantage of the blended wing body is that the energy consumption increase when adapting from kerosene to hydrogen fuel appears to be far less sensitive than the tube and wing's to empty weight and drag changes. Because we only compare hydrogen and kerosene usage within the same configuration, a hydrogen blended wing body may still consume substantially less energy than a hydrogen tube and wing. However, these results do call into question the assumed tank storage benefit of a hydrogen-powered blended wing body aircraft.}

In reality, a mission includes other flight segments contributing to fuel burn, such as climbing and descent. We aim to quantify how much performance is sacrificed by optimizing the design for a fuel burn approximation that ignores these other flight segments and flight conditions. To do this, we compare traditional approaches to mission-based optimization, which uses an accurate fuel burn objective computed by numerically integrating fuel flow across the mission profile. We find that mission-based optimization offers only marginal benefits over traditional single-point and multipoint approaches for aerostructural optimization of a narrowbody aircraft---only 1--2\% in the most extreme cases. Thus, the traditional aerostructural optimization is acceptable, especially in cases where most fuel is burned during cruise. For the
                  cases where climb fuel burn is significant, we introduce a simple change to traditional fuel burn approximation methods that allows the optimizer to find nearly all the fuel burn reduction of mission-based optimization but at the computational cost of multipoint optimization.}

Any kerosene blended wing body fuel burn benefit over a tube and wing also applies to hydrogen versions. As a result, kerosene blended wing body technology developments, such as maturing the structural design of the noncircular pressurized passenger cabin, remain valuable for future hydrogen-powered aircraft.}

The process exploits adjoint methods for the computation of gradients, and as such the computational cost is essentially independent of the number of design variables, making it ideal for optimization in large design spaces. The novelty of this paper lies in linking the adjoint surface sensitivity information with geometric sensitivity values, referred to as design velocities, computed for CAD models created in commercial CAD systems (e.g. CATIA V5 or Siemens NX). This process computes gradients based on the CAD feature parameters, which are used by the optimization algorithm, which in turn updates the values of the same parameters in the CAD model. In this paper, the design velocity and resulting gradient calculations are validated against analytical and finite-difference results. The proposed approach is
                  demonstrated to be compatible with different commercial CAD packages and computational fluid dynamics solvers.}

    abstract    = {Over the past decade, advances in multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) have enabled the optimization of aircraft wings using high-fidelity simulations of their coupled aerodynamic and structural behavior. However, as their aspect-ratios increase, these wings increasingly exhibit geometrically nonlinear behavior that cannot be correctly modeled by typical linear structural analysis methods. Although many low-fidelity aeroelastic analysis and optimization tools feature geometrically nonlinear finite element models, all examples to date of high-fidelity aerostructural optimization have been restricted to linear finite element models due to concerns over computational cost and complexity. In this work, we develop a tool for high-fidelity, geometrically nonlinear structural and aerostructural optimization and demonstrate it by performing detailed structural sizing optimization of a high aspect-ratio wingbox using high-fidelity RANS CFD and a geometrically nonlinear
                  shell finite element formulation. By comparing the results of aerostructural analysis and optimization using both geometrically linear and nonlinear structural finite element formulations, we find that geometric nonlinearity results in a 5--10\% increase in the bending stress and optimized structural mass of the wingbox. Geometrically nonlinear analysis not only results in deflected wing shapes and lift distributions which are more physically accurate, but also captures new loading phenomena within the wingbox, both of which lead to more realistic structural sizing. We also show that the increase in computational cost when optimizing with geometrically nonlinear analysis can be as low as 15\%, meaning these formulations should not be viewed as prohibitively expensive.

    abstract    = {When designing aircraft, avoiding dynamic aeroelastic instabilities such as flutter is a key requirement. One way to meet this requirement is to use a multidisciplinary design optimization subject to a flutter constraint. Flutter-constrained design optimizations have used geometrically linear detailed models, which do not accurately predict flutter for very flexible aircraft, or geometrically nonlinear low-order models, which do not accurately trade off cruise range and structural mass. This paper presents a framework for integrating a geometrically nonlinear, subsonic flutter constraint that captures the large in-flight deflections of very flexible aircraft into high-fidelity gradient-based aerostructural optimization. The cruise range and stress constraints are computed accurately with detailed aerostructural analyses, which use a built-up finite element model coupled to RANS CFD. The detailed model is condensed to a low-order aeroelastic model to compute the
                  geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint and its adjoint derivatives with computational cost and robustness suitable for optimization. The framework is demonstrated by maximizing the cruise range of a subsonic high-aspect-ratio wing with respect to panel thicknesses, sweep, and span. The impact of the geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint highly depends on the in-flight deformation level. At low deflection levels, sweeping the wing backward is the most effective flutter prevention method, and the flutter constraint has little impact on the achievable cruise range. At high deflection levels, shortening the wing span is necessary to suppress flutter, reducing the achievable cruise range by up to 5.9\%. This work is a step toward making multidisciplinary design optimization a practical tool for designing the energy-efficient, very flexible aircraft of the future, which require geometrically nonlinear flutter analyses early in the design cycle to prevent flutter. }

    abstract    = {The increasing flexibility of modern aircraft wings makes the consideration of aeroelasticity increasingly important in the earliest stages of the design process. In response to this need, the past decades have seen significant advances in the development of tools for the numerical optimization of aircraft wings considering aeroelastic interactions. These aeroelastic optimization tools optimize the structural sizing, and occasionally surface geometry, of a wing, subject to constraints such as structural failure and flutter stability, computed using aeroelastic analyses. The models used by these tools range from simple lifting line and beam models to RANS CFD and shell finite element models, each with their advantages and drawbacks. However, there have been few, if any, efforts to compare these different frameworks, mainly due to a lack of open benchmark models. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark model intended to be accessible to different researchers while
                  remaining relevant to industrial use cases in modern transport aircraft. The proposed model consists of a wing-only outer mold line, based on that of a small single-aisle transport aircraft, and a moderately detailed conformal wingbox model. We also define a set of aeroelastic optimization problems of varying complexity, ranging from a structural sizing problem with fixed geometry to more complex problems involving optimization of the structural sizing and geometry for minimum fuel burn. We present results for each of the three optimization problems generated using RANS CFD, a shell finite element model, and the MPhys multiphysics coupling library. We show that allowing the wing planform to vary from the baseline results in a 17.5% reduction in fuel burn. These models and optimization problems are intended to act as a starting point for discussions on the choice of benchmark problems for the aeroelastic optimization community.}

In general, it is more dif? cult to implement the adjoint method than the direct method, but it is shown that the use of the continuum adjoint method, along with homogeneity conditions, can alleviate the problem. Expressions for vonMises stress and local buckling sensitivities for isotropic plate elements are derived. Computational ef? ciency of the adjointmethod is sensitive to the number of constraints, and, therefore, the adjoint method bene? ts from constraint lumping. A continuum version of the Kreisselmeier--Steinhauser functional is chosen to lumpconstraints. The adjoint and direct methods are compared for three examples: a truss structure, a small high-speed civil transport (HSCT) model, and a large HSCT model. These sensitivity derivatives are then used in optimization.}

Three studies were completed which include a comparison model for the Minuteman-III intercontinental ballistic missile, an improvement to the suborbital phase of flight for a modern ICBM, and the design of a generic three-stage orbital launch vehicle. Significant performance enhancement was achieved by attaching wings to the first stage for providing aerodynamic assist. Optimization was performed by varying the geometric definition of the attached wings and core vehicle design parameters. Significant decreases in initial system weights and propellant mass fractions were achieved for a given payload with the addition of wing structure. These final results are presented in the form of effective specific impulse boost for the
                  aerodynamically assisted vehicle.}

Motivated by the working principle of decomposition-based methods, viz. the ``divide-and-conquer'' paradigm; this paper is concerned with solving black-box multi-objective problems given a finite number of function evaluations by taking inspiration from the single-objective deterministic sampling method, DIRECT. In particular, we provide a multi-objective algorithmic instance of DIRECT, which we refer to as MO-DIRECT and investigate its performance with respect to established decomposition-based multi-objective techniques. Besides its asymptotic convergence to the Pareto front and its inherent balance between exploration and exploitation of the decision space, the proposed framework is flexible enough to incorporate
                  indicator-based techniques, albeit at the cost of a greater space complexity when compared to the evolutionary counterpart.}

We propose a class of multilevel optimization methods motivated by the structure and number of constraints and by the expense of the derivative computations for MDO. The algorithms are an extension ot the nonlinear programming problem of the successful class of local Brown-Brent algorithms for nonlinear equations. Our extensions allow the user to partition constraints into arbitrary blocks to fit the application, and they separately process each block and the objective function, restricted to certain subspaces. The methods use trust regions as a globalization strategy, and they have been shown to be globally convergent under reasonable assumptions. The multilevel algorithms can be applied to all classes of MDO formulations. Multilevel algorithms for solving nonlinear systems of equations are a special
                  case of the multilevel optimization methods. In this case, they can be viewed as a trust-region globalization of the Brown-Brent class.}

    abstract    = {This book was intended as an introduction to the topic of numerical continuation which would be accessible to a readership of widely varying mathematical backgrounds. Realizing the close relationship which exists between the predictor-corrector and the piecewise linear continuation approaches, we attempted to present both methods in a unified way. In the belief that potential users of numerical continuation methods would create programs adapted to their particular needs, we presented pseudo codes and Fortran codes merely as illustrations. Indeed, there are now many specialized packages for treating such varied problems as bifurcation, polynomial systems, eigenvalues, economic equilibria, optimization, and the approximation of manifolds. It was gratifying to hear from students and young colleagues that they had learned from the book in seminars and had used it as a guidebook to write codes tailored to their needs. We hope that this edition can continue to serve such a
                  purpose. Although the original book contained a comprehensive bibliography for its time, a great deal of new literature and software has since appeared. Indeed, for this preface we must content ourselves with an updating of the literature by giving a partial listing of books, survey articles, and conference proceedings dealing with numerical continuation methods and their applications. These sources themselves contain many additional references. Similarly, concerning software, we present several URLs from which readers can hopefully proceed to look for codes which may meet their needs. Remarkably, essentially all of the books treating numerical continuation and/or bifurcation listed in the original bibliography are presently out of print, e.g., Garcia and Zangwill [14], H. B. Keller [20], Rheinboldt [31], and Todd [37]. Only the book by Seydel [35] treating bifurcation and stability analysis is still available. Govaerts has recently authored a monograph [16] on
                  numerical bifurcation of dynamical systems. This book has an extensive bibliography. A somewhat more numerically oriented book has been written by Kuznetsov [22]. Among the conference proceedings treating various aspects of numerical continuation including bifurcation, homotopy methods, and exploiting symmetry are [1, 2, 6, 19, 26, 30, 36]. Homotopy continuation methods for solving polynomial systems over complex numbers has been a very active topic. This is surveyed in the papers by Li [24, 25].}

    abstract    = {We have seen the emerging applications of deep neural networks for flow field predictions in the past few years. Most of the efforts rely on the increased complexity of the model itself or take advantage of novel network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, reaching low prediction error cannot guarantee the quality of the predicted flow fields in terms of the perceived visual quality. This work introduces the multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) index method for flow field prediction. First, we train CNN models using the commonly used root mean squared error (RMSE) loss function as the reference. Then we introduce the SSIM loss function to capture the high-level features. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of the MS-SSIM weights on the predictive performance. Our results show that while the pixel-wise prediction error of RMSE-based models is as low as $1.3141 \times 10^{−2}$, the perceived visual quality of the predicted
                  flow fields, such as contour-line smoothness, is poorly represented. In contrast, the MS-SSIM models significantly improve the perceived visual quality with an SSIM loss value as low as $7.370 \times 10^{−3}$, although having a slightly higher prediction error of $1.3912 \times 10^{−2}$. These values are 41.7\% lower in the SSIM loss and 5.9\% higher in the RMSE than the best RMSE model. In particular, we report that a weight combination of 0.3 and 0.7 for the MS-SSIM loss function provides the best predictive performance in our case. Our study has pointed out a possible future endeavor to invent a quality metric based on structural similarity, which should excel in flow-field-related approximations.}

The current approach uses adjoint (costate) variables to obtain derivatives of the cost function. The solution of the adjoint equations is obtained by using an implicit formulation in which the turbulence model is fully coupled with the flow equations when solving for the costate variables. The accuracy of the derivatives is demonstrated by comparison with finite-difference gradients and a few sample computations are shown. In addition, a user interface is described that significantly reduces the time required to set up the design problems. Recommendations on directions of further research into the Navier-Stokes design process are made.}

    abstract    = {Electrified aircraft benefit from the versatile ways electric motors can be integrated with an airframe. However, thermal management is needed to move waste heat out of the motors because the heat is not expelled with the exhaust as in a conventional engine. Plate-fin, fin, and surface heat exchangers are incorporated as air-side heat exchangers for electrified aircraft thermal management systems. Typically, analytic tools are used to design heat exchangers within these categories. However, analytic tools lack the fidelity required for detailed shaping and assessment of general heat exchanger configurations. Tools based on first principles, such as finite element analysis or computational fluid dynamics, can verify heat exchanger performance but are too costly to use in a manual design loop. Shape optimization can be used with first-principles-based models to design heat exchangers without limiting the geometry to those previously well studied. In this work, we apply
                  this methodology to design a heat sink for the high-lift motor of an electric technology demonstrator, the X-57 Maxwell. We use a gradient-based optimizer to modify the thickness distribution of the heat sink to find designs that minimize drag while meeting the heat load constraint. To model the heat transfer from the motor, we use both convection-only and conjugate heat transfer models and compare the resulting differences in the optimized shapes. We found that the convection-only model under-predicted heat rejection and thus led to larger than necessary heat sinks when used in optimization. To study the effect of the heat load on the design, we compare the heat sinks designed for the baseline motor and heat sinks designed for less efficient motors. Our study results show how the heat exchanger's geometry changes from uniformly thick to designs with fins as the heat load increases. Furthermore, we found that the variation in drag across designs is driven by
                  differences in the pressure drag due to flow separation. Finally, we conclude with a comparison of the optimized designs to those representing more simple fin designs and find that the optimized designs have fins that are shifted forward to reduce the adverse pressure gradient, which mitigates separation on the aft part of the fin. The developed shape optimization method could also be applied to improve other heat exchangers, specifically those designed to reject relatively low amounts of heat.}

    abstract    = {Aerodynamic shape optimization has become a well-established process, with designers routinely performing wing and full aircraft optimizations with hundreds of geometric design variables. However, with increased geometric design freedom comes increased optimization difficulty. These optimizations tend to converge very slowly, often taking many hundreds of design iterations. In addition, designers have to manually obtain suitable design variable scaling through trial and error in order to have a well-behaved optimization problem, which is a tedious and time-consuming task. In this work, we propose a sensitivity-based geometric parameterization approach that, while keeping the same optimization problem, maps the design space onto one which is better suited for gradient-based optimization. At the same time, we can automatically determine appropriate design variable scaling such that the new optimization problem can be solved more rapidly. We demonstrate the approach on
                  aerodynamic optimizations, and show improved convergence behaviour compared to the traditional approach.}

    abstract    = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become a vital tool for aerospace engineers. The ability to rapidly assess the performance of a design without a wind tunnel experiment or flight test has greatly increased the rate at which engineers can iterate on a design. Despite CFD's widespread adoption, its automated use remains challenging. One challenge is the development of robust and high-performance solver algorithms for a broad range of problems. Globalized Newton's methods offer a promising solution to this issue. However, selecting a suitable globalization strategy for this task requires careful analysis of possible candidates. In this work, we investigate the use of combinations of existing globalization strategies over a range of test cases. Specifically, we will compare the relative performance of combinations of pseudo-transient, boundary condition, and dissipation-based continuation. We find well tuned methods that use a mix of pseudo-transient and
                  dissipation-based continuation to be the most robust for our test problems.}

    abstract    = {We present an efficient aerodynamic shape optimization framework for optimization problems under unsteady flow conditions. The optimization framework consists of a parallel Newton-Krylov flow solver for multi-block grids and an integrated geometry parameterization and mesh-deformation algorithm based on linear elasticity. We apply the adjoint method to the discretized governing equations to compute the gradients required by the sequential quadratic programming optimization algorithm. We propose two lift-constrained drag minimization problems for the purposes of testing and evaluating the framework. First, we consider a laminar flow airfoil optimization problem at a Reynolds number of 800 and also investigate the convexity of the optimization problem. We show that the optimizer is capable of reducing the drag for this problem by about 23\% and produces a nearly steady flow compared to the vortex shedding observed for the baseline geometry at the required lift target.
                  The second benchmark case is a lift-constrained drag minimization of an aspect ratio eight rectangular wing in a laminar flow at a Reynolds number of 800. Section shape, twist, and angle of attack are free. Although only partially converged at the time of writing, the preliminary results show a 20\% drag reduction.}

Matrix-free implementations of standard optimization methods---implementations that do not explicitly form Jacobians and Hessians, and possibly use quasi-Newton approximations---circumvent those restrictions, but such implementations are virtually non-existent. We develop a matrix-free augmented-Lagrangian algorithm for nonconvex problems with both equality and inequality constraints. Our implementation is developed in the Python language, is available as an open-source package, and allows for approximating Hessian and Jacobian information.We show that our approach solves problems from the CUTEr and COPS test sets in a comparable number of iterations to state-of-the-art solvers. We report numerical results on a structural design problem that is typical in aircraft wing design optimization. The matrix-free approach makes solving
                  problems with thousands of design variables and constraints tractable, even when function and gradient evaluations are costly. }

    abstract    = {Fiber reinforced composite materials are used as structural material in airplanes because of their high specific stiffness and strength. When composite materials are subjected to mechanical loading, it leads to many types of failures such as matrix cracking, debonding, delamination, and fiber breakage. To create a better understanding of the initiation, growth and interaction of the different types of damage, damage monitoring during mechanical loading is very important. Acoustic emission is a suitable technique for the detection of a wide range of micro-structural failures in composite materials. In this present paper, GFRP composite laminates with different stacking sequences such as {$[$}0$\,^{\circ}${$]$}4, {$[$}90$\,^{\circ}${$]$}4, angle ply {$[$}$\pm$45$\,^{\circ}${$]$}4 and cross ply {$[$}0$\,^{\circ}$/90$\,^{\circ}${$]$}4 are used to trigger different failure mechanisms when subjected to flexural test (three-point bending) with AE monitoring. Discrimination
                  of the failure modes are done based on the predominance of the failure modes in each orientation. Parametric plots are used to discriminate the modes of fracture within the laminates. Range of frequency content in each orientation is investigated using fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis. FFT enables calculating the frequency content of each damage mechanism. Short Time FFT highlights the possible failure mechanisms associated with each signal. Continuous wavelet transform allowed identifying frequency range and time history for failure modes in each signal.

    abstract    = {Wind turbine upscaling is motivated by the fact that larger machines can achieve lower levelized cost of energy. However, there are several fundamental issues with the design of such turbines, and there is little public data available for large wind turbine studies. To address this need, we develop a 20 MW common research wind turbine design that is available to the public. Multidisciplinary design optimization is used to define the aeroservoelastic design of the rotor and tower subject to the following constraints: blade-tower clearance, structural stresses, modal frequencies, tip-speed and fatigue damage at several sections of the tower and blade. For the blade, the design variables include blade length, twist and chord distribution, structural thicknesses distribution and rotor speed at the rated. The tower design variables are the height, and the diameter distribution in the vertical direction. For the other components, mass models are employed to capture their
                  dynamic interactions. The associated cost of these components is obtained by using cost models. The design objective is to minimize the levelized cost of energy. The results of this research show the feasibility of a 20 MW wind turbine and provide a model with the corresponding data for wind energy researchers to use in the investigation of different aspects of wind turbine design and upscaling. }

    abstract    = {Wind energy has experienced a continuous cost reduction in the last decades. A popular cost reduction technique is to increase the rated power of the wind turbine by making it larger. However, it is not clear whether further upscaling of the existing wind turbines beyond the 5--7 MW range is technically feasible and economically attractive. To address this question, this study uses 5, 10, and 20 MW wind turbines that are developed using multidisciplinary design optimization as upscaling data points. These wind turbines are upwind, 3-bladed, pitch-regulated, variable-speed machines with a tubular tower. Based on the design data and properties of these wind turbines, scaling trends such as loading, mass, and cost are developed. These trends are used to study the technical and economical aspects of upscaling and its impact on the design and cost. The results of this research show the technical feasibility of the existing wind turbines up to 20 MW, but the design of such
                  an upscaled machine is cost prohibitive. Mass increase of the rotor is identified as a main design challenge to overcome. The results of this research support the development of alternative lightweight materials and design concepts such as a two-bladed downwind design for upscaling to remain a cost effective solution for future wind turbines.

Current trends suggest that geared ultra high bypass ratio turbofans are the next generation of commercial propulsion systems. Furthermore, the emphasis on decreasing emissions has driven the exploration of hydrogen-powered aircraft, adding to the already challenging design space. Carrying and burning hydrogen introduces complexity and weight penalties that we must offset using the fuel's thermodynamic and chemical properties. In this study, we model a closedloop water recirculation system with a zero-dimensional thermodynamic model and compare the benefits between Jet-A and hydrogen fuels. We perform a gradient-based optimization parameter sweep to explore the trade-offs between performance and emissions using both fuels with water recirculation. The results quantify the design space for
                  next-generation propulsion concepts that can take advantage of hydrogen fuel's thermodynamic properties to reduce emissions and improve performance.}

    abstract    = {Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) plays a vital role in designing aircraft. Thus, the modularization of various disciplines is necessary to efficiently couple them in MDO or multidisciplinary design analysis (MDA). In this paper, we demonstrate how recent library extensions \cite{Backhaus_2021} lead to combining both the HPC ecosystem FlowSimulator, developed by DLR and partners, and the MDA/MDO framework, OpenMDAO, for a gradient-based MDO scenario of a generic static aeroelastic problem for a transport aircraft. In the MDO problem, the software architecture enables the optimal integration of high-fidelity workflows with central data management for high performance computing (HPC). To this end, we demonstrate how the FlowSimulator Data Manager (FSDM) enables the associated HPC simulation components to exchange massively parallel data in memory. Here, the algorithms provided by OpenMDAO---linear and nonlinear solution methods, and forward and backward
                  processing of sensitivity derivatives---operate on the infrastructure of the FlowSimulator HPC ecosystem. Based on the defined scenario, different solution strategies can be applied. In this work we define a nested aeroelastic coupling setup within a trim equilibrium constraint definition. In particular, we highlight how an efficient modularization of the individual disciplines supports an effective gradient assembly and thus makes them available to the individual solution hierarchies and strategies. With this approach, we show how it is possible to transform a baseline constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained optimization definition, while still ensuring the trim equilibrium through an implicit solution based on the Schur complement method.}

    abstract    = {Constrained optimization of high-dimensional numerical problems plays an important role in many scientific and industrial applications. Function evaluations in many industrial applications are severely limited and often only little analytical information about objective function and constraint functions is available. For such expensive black-box optimization tasks, the constraint optimization algorithm COBRA (Constrained Optimization By Radial Basis Function Approximation) was proposed, making use of RBF (radial basis function) surrogate modeling for both objective and constraint functions. COBRA has shown remarkable success in solving reliably complex benchmark problems in less than 500 function evaluations. Unfortunately, COBRA requires careful adjustment of parameters in order to do so. In this work we present a new algorithm SACOBRA (Self-Adjusting COBRA), which is based on COBRA and capable of achieving high-quality results with very few function evaluations and
                  no parameter tuning. It is shown with the help of performance profiles on a set of benchmark problems (G-problems, MOPTA08) that SACOBRA consistently outperforms COBRA algorithms with different fixed parameter settings. We analyze the importance of the new elements in SACOBRA and show that each element of SACOBRA plays a role to boost up the overall optimization performance. We discuss the reasons and get in this way a better understanding of high-quality RBF surrogate modeling.}

The purpose of this paper is to summarize these principles, and to indicate methods of designing wings in accordance with them. It is important to design wings so that the type of flow obtained in practice is the same as that assumed in the design theory, and so that it is a flow which is usable---i.e. which can be predicted and controlled. It is shown that these requirements lead to the concept of a sub-critical flow which can be obtained on certain swept wings. These are restricted to a fairly narrow band of sweep angles, depending on the design Mach number, and the aspect ratio and thickness of the wings are correspondingly limited. Practical design methods are discussed in order to illustrate the physical principles used in design, but a critical comparison of different calculation methods is not attempted.}

Here, algorithmic differentiation (AD) is applied to the open-source CAD kernel Open CASCADE Technology using the AD software tool ADOL-C (Automatic Differentiation by OverLoading in C++). The differentiated CAD kernel is coupled with a discrete adjoint CFD solver, thus providing the first example of a complete differentiated design chain built from generic, multi-purpose tools. The design chain is demonstrated on the gradient-based optimization of a squared U-bend turbo-machinery cooling duct to minimize the total pressure loss.}

    abstract    = {The optimization of expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions over combinatorial structures is an ubiquitous task in machine learning, engineering and the natural sciences. The combinatorial explosion of the search space and costly evaluations pose challenges for current techniques in discrete optimization and machine learning, and critically require new algorithmic ideas. This article proposes, to the best of our knowledge, the first algorithm to overcome these challenges, based on an adaptive, scalable model that identifies useful combinatorial structure even when data is scarce. Our acquisition function pioneers the use of semidefinite programming to achieve efficiency and scalability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that this algorithm consistently outperforms other methods from combinatorial and Bayesian optimization.}

It also discusses some of the most recent developments in that area since the introduction of approximation concepts in the mid-seventies. The paper distinguishes between local, medium-range and global approximations; it covers function approximations and problem approximations. It shows that, although the lack of comparative data established on reference test cases prevents an accurate assessment, there have been significant improvements. The largest number of developments have been in the areas of local function approximations and use of intermediate variable and response quantities. It appears also that some new methodologies emerge which could greatly benefit from the introduction of new computer architectures.}

However, the number of evaluations required by surrogate models usually scales poorly with the number of design variables, and there is a need for both better constraint formulations and multimodal function handling. To address this issue, we developed a surrogate-based gradient-free optimization algorithm that can handle cases where the function evaluations are expensive, the computational budget is limited, the functions are multimodal, and the optimization problem includes nonlinear equality or inequality constraints. The proposed algorithm---super efficient global optimization coupled with mixture of experts (SEGOMOE)---can tackle complex constrained design optimization problems through the use of an enrichment strategy based on a mixture of experts coupled with adaptive surrogate models.
                  The performance of this approach was evaluated for analytic constrained and unconstrained problems, as well as for a multimodal aerodynamic shape optimization problem with 17 design variables and an equality constraint. Our results showed that the method is efficient and that the optimum is much less dependent on the starting point than the conventional gradient-based optimization.}

These accurate, flexibile and robust methods are however rather expensive in terms of computational cost. In this paper we propose to address the issue of computational efficiency of discontinuous finite element methods by introducing a ``multiorder'' discontinuous Galerkin solution strategy which is similar to a multigrid techinque but uses progressively lower order polynomial DG approximations on the same grid instead of the same discretization on progressively coarsened grids. We present the results obtained in the numerical solution of the Euler equations for the subsonic flow around a circle which give some indication of the effectiveness ot the proposed multiorder solution strategy.}

This paper documents a series of full scale tow tests intended to characterize some of the major parameters impacting the performance of a foiling Moth. Specifically: * the lift and drag was measured for of various home built and commercially available T-foil configurations, * the hydrodynamic drag of a hull was measured at various displacements, and * the aerodynamic forces (side force and drag) were measured for a hull and racks. It is hoped that this data will be useful for future designers to further push the state of the art.}

This approach makes use of a deterministic algorithm to suggest, among a list of commercially available system devices, the optimal number and type of units ensuring that the total cost of the system is minimized while guaranteeing the availability of the energy. The collection of 6 months of data of wind speed, solar radiation and ambient temperature recorded for every hour of the day were used. The mathematical modeling of the main elements of the hybrid wind/PV/diesel system is exposed showing the more relevant sizing variables. A deterministic algorithm is used to minimize the total cost of the system while guaranteeing the satisfaction of the load demand. A comparison between the total cost of the hybrid wind/PV/diesel energy system with batteries and the hybrid wind/PV/diesel energy system without batteries is presented. The reached results
                  demonstrate the practical utility of the used sizing methodology and show the influence of the battery storage on the total cost of the hybrid system.}

    abstract    = {Challenges in the scalable solution of large-scale optimization problems include the development of innovative algorithms and efficient tools for parallel data manipulation. This paper discusses two complementary toolkits from the collection of Advanced CompuTational Software (ACTS), namely, Global Arrays (GA) for parallel data management and the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO), which have been integrated to support large-scale scientific applications of unconstrained and bound constrained minimization problems. Most likely to benefit are minimization problems arising in classical molecular dynamics, free energy simulations, and other applications where the coupling among variables requires dense data structures. TAO uses abstractions for vectors and matrices so that its optimization algorithms can easily interface to distributed data management and linear algebra capabilities implemented in the GA library. The GA/TAO interfaces are available both in the
                  traditional library mode and as components compliant with the Common Component Architecture (CCA). We highlight the design of each toolkit, describe the interfaces between them, and demonstrate their use.}

    abstract    = { Physical interactions between a fluid and structure, potentially manifested as self-sustained or divergent oscillations, can be sensitive to many parameters whose values are uncertain. Of interest here are aircraft aeroelastic interactions, which must be accounted for in aircraft certification and design. Deterministic prediction of these aeroelastic behaviors can be difficult owing to physical and computational complexity. New challenges are introduced when physical parameters and elements of the modeling process are uncertain. By viewing aeroelasticity through a nondeterministic prism, where key quantities are assumed stochastic, one may gain insights into how to reduce system uncertainty, increase system robustness, and maintain aeroelastic safety. This article reviews uncertainty quantification in aeroelasticity using traditional analytical techniques not reliant on computational fluid dynamics; compares and contrasts this work with emerging methods based on
                  computational fluid dynamics, which target richer physics; and reviews the state of the art in aeroelastic optimization under uncertainty. Barriers to continued progress, for example, the so-called curse of dimensionality, are discussed. }

    abstract    = {One of the more daunting tasks of designing a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is the selection of a propulsion system that will provide desired performance. Rigorous methods for selecting these drive components, that is, the motors, propellers, and batter- ies for electric UAVs are not readily available. Currently, many UAV designs are based on legacy selections or limited and at times incorrect manufacturer data. These design methods are either simplistic or lacking in analysis and validation of component selection. Proper propulsion system design should address the mission requirements for which the vehicle is being designed. A proper design methodology is the best chance that the designer has to create a new vehicle that will be mission-capable. This paper attempts to satisfy the need for more thorough method of propulsion component selection. The paper is written also to document the popular online drive system analysis tool due to numerous requests.
                  This tool is one example implementation of the methodologies described by this paper.}

    abstract    = {The use of hydrofoils for sailing yachts is becoming more prolific. However its use in mainstream sailing classes has only become standard for the Moth dinghy class. The Moth class uses a twin T-Foil design, one on the centreboard for primary support and one on the rudder for additional support and control. The rudder T-Foil forms the basis of an experimental study carried out at the Australian Maritime College towing tank facility described here. Lift and drag data is presented for upright and heeled configurations considered indicative of windward sailing conditions. Force variation with respect to angle of incidence, depth of submergence and onset flow speed is presented using elliptical lift distribution parameters for easy design use. In addition deflection of the strut run-up was attempted to produce additional lift. Finally, a windward sailing condition prone to ventilation has been identified.}

    abstract    = {Augmented Lagrangian algorithms are very popular tools for solving nonlinear programming problems. At each outer iteration of these methods a simpler optimization problem is solved, for which efficient algorithms can be used, especially when the problems are large. The most famous Augmented Lagrangian algorithm for minimization with inequality constraints is known as Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar (PHR) method. The main drawback of PHR is that the objective function of the subproblems is not twice continuously differentiable. This is the main motivation for the introduction of many alternative Augmented Lagrangian methods. Most of them have interesting interpretations as proximal point methods for solving the dual problem, when the original nonlinear programming problem is convex. In this paper a numerical comparison between many of these methods is performed using all the suitable problems of the CUTE collection.}

A special emphasis of this work is the performance for a relative high number of processors, i.e. with a low number of elements on the processor. For high order DG discretizations, a particular problem that needs to be addressed is the size of the blocks in the Jacobian. Thus, we propose a new class of preconditioners that exploits the hierarchy of modal basis functions and introduces a flexible order of the off-diagonal Jacobian blocks. While the standard preconditioners `block Jacobi' (no off-blocks) and full symmetric Gauss--Seidel (full off-blocks) are included as special cases, the reduction of the off-block order results in the new scheme ROBO-SGS. This allows us to investigate
                  the impact of the preconditioner's sparsity pattern with respect to the computational performance. Since the number of iterations is not well suited to judge the efficiency of a preconditioner, we additionally consider CPU time for the comparisons. We found that both block Jacobi and ROBO-SGS have good overall performance and good strong parallel scaling behavior.}

Many of these computations are done in MATLAB, a popular environment for technical computing providing engineers and scientists with capabilities for mathematical computing, analysis, visualization, and algorithmic development. For functions written in the MATLAB language, a novel software tool is proposed to automatically transform a given MATLAB program into another MATLAB program capable of computing not only the original function but also user-specified derivatives of that function. That is, a program transformation known as automatic differentiation is performed to change the semantics of the program in a fashion based on the chain rule of differential calculus. The crucial ingredient of the tool is a combination of source-to-source transformation and operator overloading. The overall design of the tool is described and numerical experiments are reported
                  demonstrating the efficiency of the resulting code for a sample problem.}

For simple functions, symbolic differentiation--done either manually or with a computer algebra system--can provide the derivatives, whereas divided differences (DD) have been used traditionally for functions defined by (potentially very complex) computer programs, even if only approximate values can be obtained this way. An alternative approach for such functions is automatic differentiation (AD), yielding exact derivatives at often lower cost than DD, and without restrictions on the program complexity. In this paper we compare the functionality and describe the use of ADMIT/ADMAT and ADiMat. These two AD tools provide derivatives for programs written in the MATLAB language, which is widely used for prototype and production software in scientific and engineering applications. While ADMIT/ADMAT implements a pure operator overloading approach of AD,
                  ADiMat also employes source transformation techniques.}

    abstract    = {Electric propulsion (EP) systems offer considerably more degrees of freedom (DOFs) within the design process of aircraft compared to conventional aircraft engines. This requires large, computationally expensive design space explorations (DSE) with coupled models of the single components to incorporate interdependencies during optimization. The purpose of this paper is to exemplarily study these interdependencies of system key performance parameters (KPIs), e.g., system mass and efficiency, for a varying DC link voltage level of the power transmission system considering the example of the propulsion system of the CENTRELINE project, including an electric motor, a DC/AC inverter, and the DC power transmission cables. Each component is described by a physically derived, analytical model linking specific subdomains, e.g., electromagnetics, structural mechanics and thermal analysis, which are used for a coupled system model. This approach strongly enhances model accuracy
                  and simultaneously keeps the computational effort at a low level. The results of the DSE reveal that the system KPIs improve for higher DC link voltage despite slightly inferior performance of motor and inverter as the mass of the DC power transmission cable has a major share for a an aircraft of the size as in the CENTRELINE project. Modeling of further components and implementation of optimization strategies will be part of future work.}

A small system of equations, only involving the boundary nodes, has to be solved and no grid-connectivity information is needed. The method can handle large mesh deformations caused by translations, rotations and deformations, both for 2D and 3D meshes. However, the performance depends on the used RBF. The best accuracy and robustness with the highest efficiency are obtained with a C2 continuous RBF with compact support, closely followed by the thin plate spline. The deformed meshes are suitable for flow computations as is shown by performing calculations around a NACA-0012 airfoil.}

    abstract    = {The application of gradient-based optimization to wing design could potentially reveal revolutionary new wing concepts. Giving the optimizer the freedom to discover novel wing designs may increase the likelihood of multimodality in the design space. To address this issue, we investigate the existence and possible sources of multimodality in the aerodynamic shape optimization of a rectangular wing. Our test case, specified by the ADODG Case 6, has a high dimensionality design space and a large degree of flexibility within that design space. We study several subproblems of this benchmark test case and analyze the multimodality introduced by each set of variables considering both inviscid and viscous analysis. This methodical approach allows us to isolate a few instances where certain parametrizations create a multimodal design space. However, we demonstrate that these occurrences of multimodality are either due to modeling inaccuracies or can be curbed by the
                  application of practical design constraints. Additionally, we find that the shape of the optimized wing is highly dependent on the interplay between induced and parasite drag, providing more incentive to consider viscous effects in the analysis. As an example, when minimizing drag with respect to chord distribution, there are multiple local minima at low CL , but a single global minimum (the elliptical planform) at high CL . These results will help other researchers to avoid some of the pitfalls that could lead to multimodality in wing optimization.}

    abstract    = {The Aerion AS2 is poised to make supersonic transportation viable and drastically reduce transoceanic travel time. The design of a supersonic transport aircraft is challenging because experience with this type of aircraft is scarce. Achieving the required range at supersonic speeds requires a refined design with the best combination of aerodynamic and structural performance. Adequate transonic cruise performance is also required due to mission segments overland. To address these issues, we perform CFD-based aerostructural design of the Aerion AS2 supersonic business jet configuration. The aerostructural optimization simultaneously varies structural sizing and wing shape variables to maximize a combination of supersonic and transonic cruise ranges. We examine the design trades between these two ranges by generating sets of Pareto-optimal designs. Optimizations that include wing planform design variables achieve the best design trades, but maximizing supersonic range
                  is particularly challenging. Overall, these initial results show that CFD-based multidisciplinary design optimization is fast enough that we can perform this type of extensive design exploration before the detailed design stage.}

Most previous applications involve fine-tuning a well-designed aircraft wing. In this work, we broaden the scope of the optimization problem by exploring the design space of aerostructural wing design optimization. We start with a rectangular wing and optimize the aerodynamic shape and the sizing of the internal structure to achieve minimum fuel burn on a transonic cruise mission. We use a multi-level optimization procedure to decrease computational cost by 40\%. We demonstrate that the optimization can transform the rectangular wing into a swept, tapered wing typical of a transonic aircraft. The optimizer converges to the same wing shape when starting from a different initial design. Additionally, we use a separation constraint at a low-speed, high-lift condition to improve the off-design performance of the optimized wing. The separation
                  constraint results in a substantially different wing design with better low-speed performance and only a slight decrease in cruise performance.}

However, collaborations between academia and industry rarely put MDO to the test on practical design problems. In this work, MDO is applied to the design of a regional jet wing to minimize fuel burn. High-fidelity aerostructural analysis is used to model the wing and capture tradeoffs between structural weight and aerodynamic performance. A novel approach is used to calculate fuel burn for climb and descent using a low-fidelity model, improving the relevancy of the optimization results for short-haul missions. A wing-only geometry is used to explore the design space and generate a series of Pareto fronts for different geometric parametrizations. Finally, an aerostructural optimization is conducted with a complete wing-body-tail geometry of an Embraer regional jet. The optimizer increases the wingspan and decreases the
                  sweep of the original wing to achieve a 3.6\% decrease in fuel burn.}

A multi-disciplinary optimization procedure is presented that marries the overall sizing of the machine in terms of rotor diameter and tower height (often termed ``preliminary design'') with the detailed sizing of its aerodynamic and structural components. The proposed combined preliminary-detailed approach sizes the overall machine while taking into full account the subtle and complicated couplings that arise due to the mutual effects of aerodynamic and structural choices. Since controls play a central role in dictating performance and loads, control laws are also updated accordingly during optimization. As part of the approach, rotor and tower are sized simultaneously, even in this case capturing the mutual effects of one component over the other due to the tip clearance constraint. The procedure, here driven by detailed models of the cost of energy, results in a complete aero-structural
                  design of the machine, including its associated control laws.}

Evaluation of merit function and constraints is performed by running simulations with a parametric high-fidelity aero-servo-elastic model; a detailed cross-sectional structural model is used for the minimum weight constrained sizing of the rotor blade. To reduce the computational cost, the multi-disciplinary optimization is performed by a multi-stage process that first alternates between an aerodynamic shape optimization step and a structural blade optimization one, and then combines the two to yield the final optimum solution. A complete design loop can be performed using the proposed algorithm using standard desktop computing hardware in one-two days.

    abstract    = {Surrogate models provide an affordable alternative to the evaluation of expensive deterministic functions. However, the construction of accurate surrogate models with many independent variables is currently prohibitive because they require a large number of function evaluations for the desired accuracy. Gradient-enhanced kriging has the potential to reduce the number of evaluations when efficient gradient computation, such as an adjoint method, is available. However, current gradient-enhanced kriging methods do not scale well with the number of sampling points because of the rapid growth in the size of the correlation matrix, where new information is added for each sampling point in each direction of the design space. Furthermore, they do not scale well with the number of independent variables because of the increase in the number of hyperparameters that must be estimated. To address this issue, we develop a new gradient-enhanced surrogate model approach that
                  drastically reduces the number of hyperparameters through the use of the partial least squares method to maintain accuracy. In addition, this method is able to control the size of the correlation matrix by adding only relevant points defined by the information provided by the partial least squares method. To validate our method, we compare the global accuracy of the proposed method with conventional kriging surrogate models on two analytic functions with up to 100 dimensions, as well as engineering problems of varied complexity with up to 15 dimensions. We show that the proposed method requires fewer sampling points than conventional methods to obtain the desired accuracy, or it provides more accuracy for a fixed budget of sampling points. In some cases, we get models that are over three times more accurate than previously developed surrogate models for the same computational time, and over 3200 times faster than standard gradient-enhanced kriging models for the same
                  accuracy.}

Existing airfoil design tools require at least a few minutes to analyze a new shape and hours to perform shape optimization. To drastically reduce the computational time of both analysis and design optimization, we use machine learning to create a model of a wide range of possible airfoils at a range of flight conditions, making it possible to perform airfoil design optimization in a few seconds. The machine learning consists of gradient-enhanced artificial neural networks where the gradient information is phased in gradually. This new gradient-enhanced artificial neural network approach is trained to model the aerodynamic force coefficients of airfoils in both subsonic and transonic regimes. The aerodynamics is modeled with Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) based computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The proposed approach outperforms an existing airfoil model that uses a mixture of
                  experts technique combined with a gradient-based Kriging surrogate model. The approach yields to similar airfoil shape optimization solutions than high-fidelity CFD optimization solutions with a difference of 0.01 count and 0.12 count for C d in subsonic and transonic regimes, respectively. Airfoil optimization problems are solved in a few seconds (instead of hours using CFD-based optimization), making the design process much more interactive, as demonstrated in the Webfoil airfoil design optimization tool.}

Next, we present an overview of electrical components and electric propulsion architectures. We survey existing commercial products, prototypes, demonstrators, and conceptual studies, and develop a list of potential benefits and disadvantages of electric propulsion with estimates of potential benefit. We present an introduction to power electronics, electric machines, and batteries for aircraft designers, and explore the emerging problem of aircraft thermal management. We review modeling, simulation, and multidisciplinary optimization
                  capabilities, and identify current shortcomings. We conclude that the electric aircraft design problem introduces new coupling between previously distinct disciplines, such as aerodynamics and propulsion, which may only become apparent with high-fidelity, physics-based analysis. High-fidelity multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization of electric aircraft, including safety and economic analysis, remains an open challenge.}

However, no known aerodynamic optimization framework can handle spatial integration constraints derived directly from three-dimensional (3-D) geometry. A general geometric constraint formulation based on triangulated 3-D geometry is proposed. The constraint consists of two metrics: the length of the intersection curve(s) between any two objects, and the Kreisselmeier--Steinhauser function aggregated minimum distance. The proposed implementation of the intersection and distance computations is fast and analytically
                  differentiable with respect to geometric design variables, making it suitable for efficient gradient-based optimization. The constraint formulation is validated using three Reynoldsaveraged Navier--Stokes-based aerodynamic shape optimization problems: a 2-D fairing design problem, a 3-D fairing design problem, and the design of an aeroshell to surround a human avatar. It is shown that this approach is robust and efficient, enabling the aerodynamic optimization of bodies containing objects with arbitrary shapes.}

    abstract    = {Electric aircraft propulsion is an intriguing path towards sustainable aviation, but the technological challenges are significant. Bulky and heavy electrical components such as batteries create spatial integration and aircraft performance challenges, especially for longer-range aircraft. A common thread among all aircraft with electric propulsion is the close coupling of aircraft design disciplines, such as aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, controls, and thermal management. Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) is a promising technique for solving design problems with many closely-coupled physical disciplines. The first half of this dissertation focuses on MDO of electric aircraft considering systems modeling. First, design of electric aircraft is reviewed in detail from the perspective of the various disciplines. Next, methods and models for electric aircraft propulsion systems are introduced. A case study involving a general aviation airplane is explored
                  in order to validate the performance of the methods and generate some insight into the tradespace for series hybrid aircraft. The systems modeling approach is then extended to include basic thermal management systems. The prior case study is revisisted while considering thermal constraints. Impact of thermal management on aircraft performance is assessed. The thermal management analysis methods are validated using flight test data from the Pipistrel Velis Electro, finding good agreement between experiment and simulation. Finally, an MDO model of a parallel hybrid electric transport aircraft with a liquid-cooled thermal management system is constructed. Sensitivities of aircraft performance with respect to important technologies parameters are computed. This first half introduces the first publicly-available simulation tool that can handle unsteady thermal states and that offers efficient and accurate gradients. The methods are very efficient, enabling users to perform
                  dozens or hundreds of optimization runs in a short amount of time using modest computational resources. Other novel contributions include the first empirical validation of thermal management models for MDO against real flight test data, as well as the only comprehensive look so far at the unsteady thermal management of a transport-scale parallel hybrid aircraft. The second half of the dissertation introduces novel methods for performing high-fidelity shape optimization studies subject to packaging or spatial integration constraints. A new mathematical formulation for generalized packaging constraints is introduced. The constraint formulation is demonstrated on simple aerodynamic shape optimization test cases. Next, a wing design study involving optimal battery packaging is conducted in order to demonstrate the coupling of outer mold line design and propulsion system component design via spatial integration. Finally, a more complex aerostructural optimization involving
                  the wing of a hydrogen aircraft is constructed and solved. These test cases demonstrate the interdisciplinary coupling introduced by packaging constraints, as well as the impact of spatial integration on aircraft performance. This latter half contributes a powerful new way for MDO engineers to pose realistic spatial constraints in their shape optimization problems, thus solving an important practical barrier to the industrial adoption of MDO for certain relevant problems. This work also represents the first time an MDO problem has been posed and solved for an aircraft using hydrogen fuel in the wing. Altogether, this dissertation significantly advances the state of the art in modeling, simulation, and optimization tools for aircraft with electric propulsion architectures and introduces new insights into the design spaces for several diverse aircraft configurations.}

    abstract    = {Hydrogen has been identified as a potential fuel for air transportation without carbon emissions. Hydrogen contains much higher energy per unit mass than any conceivable rechargeable battery, potentially making longer-range missions possible than pure electric configurations. However, hydrogen's low volumetric energy density presents practical challenges. Hydrogen must either be kept under deep cryogenic conditions or compressed under very high pressure. Either solution is likely to require adding significant drag and tank weight to the airplane. This is a packing optimization problem subject to aerostructural physics, and we can employ multidisciplinary design optimization techniques to provide insight into optimal wing design for novel hydrogen aircraft concepts. In this paper, we extend prior work on wing packing optimization subject to aerodynamics only, and now incorporate structural analysis and structure geometry into the problem. We optimize the range of a
                  hydrogen-electric aircraft with hydrogen fuel storage located inside the wing outer mold line. The geometry of the hydrogen storage tanks influences the shape of the wing as well as the weight and volumetric capacity of the tank. While the effect of hydrogen storage on other aircraft concepts cannot be generalized from this study, the optimization methods we use are promising for performing relevant aircraft design trade studies. The optimizer finds the correct tradeoff between weight, drag, and fuel storage for the mission, subject to spatial integration feasibility. In our test scenario, we find that the optimal aerostructural design involves substantial wing root thickening.}

In this context, suitable tools have to be developed for solving aerodynamic shape optimisation problems, and the adjoint approach---which allows fast and accurate evaluations of the gradients with respect to the design parameters---is proved to be very efficient to eliminate the shock on aircraft wing in transonic flow. However, few applications were presented so far considering other design problems involving 3D viscous flows. This paper describes how the adjoint approach can also help the designer to efficiently reduce the flow separation onset at wing--fuselage intersection and to optimise the slat and flap positions of a 3D high-lift configuration. On all these cases, the optimisations were successfully performed within a limited number of flow evaluations, emphasising the benefit of the adjoint approach in aircraft

The optimization study is performed on a subsonic small-scale cavity-stabilized combustor. Steady, compressible three-dimensional simulations are performed using a multi-phase Realizable k-ε Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach or Dynamic Kinetic Energy Subgrid-scale LES. There are nineteen geometrical input parameters and four output parameters, viz., a pattern factor proxy (maximum exit temperature), a combustion efficiency proxy (averaged exit temperature), total pressure losses (TPL), and ``melting'' liner area. The RANS-based optimization with initial training sample of sixty design points leads to an optimum design point that dominates the baseline design, among other designs. The non-dominated design points release 57\\% of the heat inside the cavity in comparison to 43\\%
                  from the baseline. Dominated combustors release as low as 23\\% of the heat in the cavity. The optimum, a dominated and the baseline design are compared with LES counterparts. The RANS predicted trends in terms of dominated and non-dominated design points were also confirmed by LES simulations, even though the output parameters quantitative values may differ. Discrepancies between RANS and LES appear more pronounced for the optimum design. This is attributed to the fact the LES permits pressure waves to escape the domain whereas RANS can only moderate pressure-induced disturbances. By allowing boundary-induced disturbances in the LES the flow field resembles that of RANS. Therefore, it is concluded that RANS and LES follow similar total pressure loss, pattern factor, and combustion efficiency trends as function of combustor design.}

    abstract    = {Since its introduction the NASA Common Research Model (CRM) has served as a useful aerodynamic benchmark for drag prediction and optimization of various CFD codes. The model was originally conceived as a purely aerodynamic benchmark and as such the geometry of the wing was designed to take the shape of the deflected wing at a 1.0 g flight condition. There has been growing interest in extending this model to aeroelastic studies as well. However, due to its predefined deflection, the model as is isn't suitable for aeroelastic analysis and design. To address this we define an undeflected Common Research Model (uCRM) which includes the outer mold line (OML) geometry of the undeflected wing and the corresponding internal wing box structure, with the goal of achieving the flying shape of the CRM under nominal flight conditions. The topology of the wing box is designed to be similar to that of a Boeing 777. The jig shape was arrived at through an inverse design procedure
                  where the objective was to minimize the difference between the 1.0 g aerostructurally deflected shape and the CRM. Since the original CRM has an aspect ratio of 9 we refer to this model as the uCRM-9. Since modern transport aircraft are trending toward higher aspect ratio wing designs in an attempt to reduce induced drag, and therefore fuel burn, it was desired to have an additional higher aspect ratio variant of this model, to assess the design potential of new future technologies with. This variant, uCRM-13.5, has a larger aspect ratio of 13.5 and is defined through an aerostructural optimization of the uCRM-9 with considerations for buffet. The goal for both of these models is to define a useful benchmark for aeroelastic wing analysis and design optimization studies.}

    abstract    = {Automatic fiber placement machines have made it viable to manufacture composites where fiber angles vary continuously---tow-steered composites. The additional freedom provided by tow-steered composites has the potential to increase structural performance; however, this approach comes with added design complexity. Numerical optimization can address this complexity, though it is critical that constraints are enforced to ensure that the resulting optimal tow-steered designs are manufacturable using current automatic fiber placement machines. In this work, we consider two manufacturing constraints: tow path curvature and gaps/overlaps. To develop these constraints, we consider a general tow-steered layer pattern as a 2D unit vector field, where the field streamlines represent the tow paths laid down by the automated fiber placing machine. This mathematical formulation provides a relationship between tow path curvature, gap/overlap propagation rate, vector curl, and
                  divergence. These relationships also lead to a constraint on the minimum cut/add length of a tow for a given tow-steered pattern. We demonstrate the developed constraint formulations on two analytical examples, as well as on a structural optimization. We also explore the relationship between curl and divergence of rotated tow patterns. This analysis leads to the conclusion that layups featuring such patterns require strict constraints on bounds to ensure satisfaction of manufacturability requirements. Finally, we use these relationships to motivate a family of gap/overlap-free and curvature-free tow-steered patterns.}

    abstract    = {Over the past several decades, composites have increasingly become the material of choice in modern aircraft structural design. This is primarily due to the high stiffness- and strength-to-weight ratios offered by conventional composites when compared to metals. Unconventional composite designs, such as tow-steered composites, have demonstrated potential for further expanding these advantages. Unlike their conventional composite counterparts, tow-steered composites feature layers with spatially varying fiber orientations. When applied to wing design, tow-steered composites offer an increase in design freedom at the cost of higher design complexity, making them ideal candidates for design optimization. We develop a methodology for the aerostructural design optimization of tow-steered composite wings using high-fidelity physics models. We also quantify the benefits of this new technology by performing a fuel burn minimization for both a tow-steered and a conventional
                  composite wing design. This assessment is done for the undeflected Common Research Model, which is representative of a twin-aisle transport aircraft. We find improvements of up to 2.4\% in fuel burn and 24\% in wing weight relative to the optimized conventional composite design. We show that this improvement is due to a combination of improved passive aeroelastic tailoring and local strength tailoring in high-stress regions in the tow-steered structure. For a higher-aspect-ratio (13.5) wing design, we find improvements of up to 1.5\% and 14\% in fuel savings and wing weight, respectively. To better understand the effect of aspect ratio on tow-steered wing design, we perform an optimization study where the aspect ratio is varied between 7.5 and 13.5. We found that there are diminishing returns in the benefit of tow steering as the aspect ratio is increased because less passive load alleviation is possible.}

With the maturation of automated fiber placement, the design of unconventional composites featuring spatially varying tow orientations has become possible, but it is not yet clear how to utilize this new design freedom optimally. Wing design optimization studies are performed for three different material technologies: aluminum alloy, conventional carbon-fiber-reinforced composite, and tow-steered carbonfiber-reinforced composite. To explore the design trades of these materials, Pareto fronts for the competing objectives of fuel burn and structural weight are generated through gradient-based optimization. These two objectives serve as surrogates for the direct operating cost and acquisition cost of the aircraft, respectively. All optimized wings took advantage of some amount of passive load alleviation at the
                  high-lift maneuver condition. Although the performance increase of tow-steered composite wings was not as dramatic as the performance increase of conventional composite relative to aluminum, the improvement was still significant. This work provides a methodology that can be used to explore tradeoffs in tow-steered wing designs and could be extended to other structural technologies.}

The methodology can be applied to assess the efficiency of a given approach, where efficiency is defined in terms of accuracy per unit cost measured in central processing unit time. The procedure is presented by demonstrating its application to the parallel Newton--Krylov--Schur finite difference flow solver known as Diablo. The benchmark cases to which the procedure is applied are two-dimensional turbulent flows modeled using the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations on three families of NACA 0012 grids with three sets of operating conditions. Performance statistics are presented in a variety of ways that show the relationships between central processing unit time, grid spacing, and accuracy in ways that are informative for both flow solver users and developers.}

The new continuation methods, described as monolithic homotopy continuation, differ from the classical predictor--corrector algorithm in that the predictor and corrector phases are replaced with a single phase which includes both a predictor and corrector component. Conditional convergence and stability are proved analytically. Using a Laplacian-like operator to construct the homotopy, the new algorithm is shown to be more efficient than the predictor--corrector homotopy continuation algorithm as well as an implementation of the widely-used pseudo-transient continuation algorithm for some inviscid and turbulent, subsonic and transonic external aerodynamic flows over the ONERA M6 wing and the NACA 0012 airfoil using a parallel implicit Newton--Krylov finite-difference flow solver.}

    abstract    = {Abstract In this article, the structural composite design process is presented. It is shown that it is an extremely complicated task conducted nowadays with computers and numerical tools. It involves several disciplines, including computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), in an iterative process where optimization plays a very important role. The CAE of composite structures is described, and several ways to parameterize the laminates are explained. These parameterizations form the basis for the introduction of formulations for the structural composite optimal design, which is the main topic addressed here. Several optimization approaches have been proposed over the past years, but a global solution is not yet available. The ultimate solution procedure should address the problem at the CAD-CAE-CAM levels simultaneously, in order to provide light and safe designs that are ready to manufacture. Since the
                  aeronautics industry has driven the innovation in structural composite design, most of the concepts described here are based on the developments carried out for large composite aircrafts.}

    abstract    = {In implicit upwind methods for the solution of linearized Euler equations, one of the key issues is to balance large time steps, leading to a fast convergence behavior, and small time steps, needed to sufficiently resolve relevant flow features. A time step is determined by choosing a Courant--Friedrichs--Levy (CFL) number in every iteration. A novel CFL evolution strategy is introduced and compared with two existing strategies. Numerical experiments using the adaptive multiscale finite volume solver QUADFLOW demonstrate that all three CFL evolution strategies have their advantages and disadvantages. A fourth strategy aiming at reducing the residual as much as possible in every time step is also examined. Using automatic differentiation, a sensitivity analysis investigating the influence of the CFL number on the residual is carried out confirming that, today, CFL control is still a difficult and open problem.

    abstract    = {Novel aircraft configurations and technologies like adaptive morphing trailing edges offer the potential to improve the fuel efficiency of commercial transport aircraft. To accurately quantify the benefits of morphing wing technology for commercial transport aircraft, high-fidelity design optimization that considers both aerodynamic and structural design with a large number of design variables is required. To address this need, we use a high fidelity aerostructural model that enables the detailed optimization of wing shape and sizing using hundreds of design variables. We perform a number of multipoint aerostructural optimizations to demonstrate the performance benefits offered by morphing technology and identify how those benefits are enabled. In a comparison of optimizations considering seven flight conditions, the addition of a morphing trailing edge device along the aft 40\% of the wing can reduce cruise fuel burn by more than 5\%. A large portion of fuel burn
                  reduction due to morphing trailing edges results from a significant reduction in structural weight, enabled by adaptive maneuver load alleviation. We also show that a smaller morphing device along the aft 30\% of the wing produces nearly as much fuel burn reduction as the larger morphing device, and that morphing technology is particularly effective for high aspect ratio wings.}

    abstract    = {Nonmorphing, conventional aircraft wings are designed for a compromise of good performance at a variety of flight conditions. Accordingly, such wings perform suboptimally when considered at a single flight condition. Morphing trailing-edge devices offer an opportunity to change this wing design paradigm by allowing wings to adapt to varying flight conditions. This adaptability weakens the correlation between performance at various flight conditions and increases the robustness of the wing's performance, providing closer-to-optimal performance at each flight condition. To study the isolated aerodynamic effects of this increased robustness, we perform a number of aerodynamic and aerostructural shape optimizations of a morphing trailing-edge device that can change the shape of the rear 10\% of the wing at a variety of flight conditions on the Common Research Model aircraft configuration. The aerodynamically optimized morphing configuration yields a 1.0\% fuel burn
                  reduction for a long-range mission. When performing aerostructural optimization, which considers structural deformations and structural weight reductions enabled by active load alleviation, the fuel burn reduction is 2.7\%.}

Multidisciplinary optimization (MDO), a formal methodology for the integration of these disci plines, is evolving toward methods capable of replacing the traditional sequential methodology of aerospace vehi cle design by concurrent algorithms, with both an overall gain in product performance and a decrease in design time. A parallel MDO paradigm using variable-complexity modeling and multipoint response surface approxima tions is presented here for the particular instance of the design of a high-speed civil transport (HSCT). This para digm interleaves the disciplines at one level of complexity and processes them hierarchically at another level of complexity, achieving parallelism within disciplines rather than across disciplines. A master-slave paradigm manages a coarse-grained parallelism of the analysis and optimization codes required by
                  the disciplines showing reasonable speedups and efficiencies on an Intel Paragon. }

Furthermore, commercial air traffic is expected to resume the continuous growth experienced until the pandemic, highlighting the need for reduced emissions. The use of alternative fuels plays a key role in achieving future emission goals, while also lowering the dependency on fossil fuels. The so-called sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), which encompass bio and synthetic fuels, are currently the most viable option, but hydrogen is also being considered as a long-term solution. The present paper reviews the production methods, logistical and technological barriers, and potential for future mass implementation of these alternative fuels. In general, biofuels currently present higher technological readiness levels than other alternatives. Sustainable mass production faces critical feedstock-related challenges that synthetic fuels, together
                  with other solutions, can overcome. All conventional fuel replacements, though with different scopes, will be important in meeting long-term goals. Government support will play an important role in accelerating and facilitating the transition towards sustainable aviation.},

They provide good data locality so that even a high-latency workstation network can be employed as a parallel machine. We call the combination of these two methods Newton-Krylov-Schwarz and report numerical experiments on some algorithmic and implementation aspects: the use of mixed discretization schemes in the (implicitly defined) Jacobian and its preconditioner, the selection of the differencing parameter in the formation of the action of the Jacobian, the use of a coarse grid in additive Schwarz preconditioning, and workstation network implementation. Three model problems are considered: a convection-diffusion problem, the full potential

The specific features of the black-box-type objective function make the problem suitable for the application of DIRECT-type algorithms. The objective function is given by numerical iterative procedures, which could lead to inaccurate derivative calculations. In addition, the presence of local minima cannot be excluded a priori. The algorithms proposed (namely DIRMIN and DIRMIN-2) are hybridizations of the classic DIRECT algorithm, with deterministic derivative-free local searches. The algorithms' performances are first assessed on a set of test problems, and then applied to the ship optimization application. The numerical results show that the local hybridization of the DIRECT algorithm has beneficial effects on the overall computational cost and on the efficiency of the

    abstract    = {{A major challenge in structural health monitoring (SHM) is to accurately identify both the location and severity of damage using the dynamic response information acquired. While in theory the vibration-based and impedance-based methods may facilitate damage identification with the assistance of a credible baseline finite element model, the response information is generally limited, and the measurements may be heterogeneous, making an inverse analysis using sensitivity matrix difficult. Aiming at fundamental advancement, in this research we cast the damage identification problem into an optimization problem where possible changes of finite element properties due to damage occurrence are treated as unknowns. We employ the multiple damage location assurance criterion (MDLAC), which characterizes the relation between measurements and predictions (under sampled elemental property changes), as the vector-form objective function. We then develop an enhanced,
                  multi-objective version of the dividing rectangles (DIRECT) approach to solve the optimization problem. The underlying idea of the multi-objective DIRECT approach is to branch and bound the unknown parametric space to converge to a set of optimal solutions. A new sampling scheme is established, which significantly increases the efficiency in minimizing the error between measurements and predictions. The enhanced DIRECT algorithm is particularly suited to solving for unknowns that are sparse, as in practical situations structural damage affects only a small region. A number of test cases using vibration response information are executed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach.}}

One aspect, aerostructural coupling, calls for design tools that are both accurate and computationally efficient. In this paper, we present a combined-fidelity approach that couples high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics and computational solid mechanics simulations, with a conventional aeroelastic turbine modeling tool based on blade element momentum and beam theories. The approach is integrated into a multidisciplinary optimization framework. It takes advantage of the high-fidelity tightly-coupled aerostructural simulations to evaluate the rotor power production and uses conventional unsteady simulations to add structural sizing constraints. We show that the overall method is effective to obtain improved optimal designs that are resistant to extreme and fatigue loads.
                  Finally, we discuss the computational cost and benefits of the proposed approach for the design of wind turbine rotors.}

Straightforward differentiation of these programs yields an iterative recurrence that involves both the derivative of the residual, and the derivative of the original process. For a certain class of these problems, the derivative recurrence can be {\em simplified\/} to avoid computing the derivative of the original process. A program implementing a simplified recurrence should run faster than its fully differentiated counterpart, since it avoids the redundant computation. In this paper we demonstrate a method for using automatic differentiation tools to facilitate the production of simplified derivative recurrence programs. We illustrate our technique by constructing and validating a simplified derivative version of the OVERFLOW computational fluid dynamics program using the ADIFOR automatic differentiation tool.}

The accuracy of the MQ method is dependent on a user defined parameter R2, and most practitioners select R2 based upon the number of data points and the locations of the (xi, yi) in the plane. We observe that the optimal value of R2 is a strong function of the zi, and that it is essentially independent of both the number and the locationsof the (xi, yi) points. Contrary to some opinions, we observe that the MQ method can effectively interpolate to ``track data'', that is, data sampled densely along tracks in the plane. Together with several other observations, we present an algorithm that generally yields an effective value for R2.}

    abstract    = {ATE functional aim is to modify the wing TE shape at high speed in order to obtain an improvement in lift over drag (LoD) ratio in the whole flight envelope, virtually obtaining a wing working always at its actual LoD optimum level. This allows to compensate the weight reduction following the fuel burning and to increase climb and descent A/C performance levels. Initial morphed shapes specification has been obtained by a multidisciplinary optimization process matching the aerodynamic performances and structural loads on wing with a defined level of structural strain for an acceptable duration of skin material life cycle. The so obtained different wing seamless shapes have been further parametrically investigated from aerodynamic point of view so to obtain the most profitable device span and chord extension. Based on these requirements, a full-scale ATE functional concept demonstrator has been designed, sized, and realized, based on reference wing geometry of a 130
                  Pax jet engines regional A/C with a range of 3000 nautical miles, cruise Mach 0.75, and flight level 35,000 ft. Reference wing aerodynamic studies show the best ATE performances in a relatively high CL range (above 0.5) and for Mach below 0.6. Additional exploitation of ATE has been performed on a light business jet, designed to carry 4 passengers at a speed of Mach 0.65, or fly 1200 nm with 2 passengers. CL range of this A/C is relatively small (below 0.6). In this wing working range, the ATE application seems not to be effective.}

It enables the creation of efficient low-order, medium fidelity models particularly suitable for structural sizing, aeroelastic analysis and optimization at the conceptual design level. The whole methodology is based on the integration of geometry construction, aerodynamic and structural analysis codes that combine depictive, computational, analytical, and semi-empirical methods, validated in an aircraft design environment. The work here presented aims at including the airframe and its effect from the very beginning of the conceptual design. This aspect is usually not considered in this early phase. In most
                  cases, very simplified formulas and datasheets are adopted, which implies a low level of detail and a poor accuracy. Through NeoCASS, a preliminar distribution of stiffness and inertias can be determined, given the initial layout. The adoption of empirical formulas is reduced to the minimum in favor of simple numerical methods. This allows to consider the aeroelastic behavior and performances, as well, improving the accuracy of the design tools during the iterative steps and lowering the development costs and reducing the time to market. The result achieved is a design tool based on computational methods for the aero-structural analysis and Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) of aircraft layouts at the conceptual design stage. A complete case study regarding the TransoniCRuiser aircraft, including validation of the results obtained using industrial standard tools like MSC/NASTRAN and a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) code, is reported. As it will be shown, it is
                  possible to improve the degree of fidelity of the conceptual design process by including tailored numerical tools, overcoming the lacks of statistical methods. The result is a method minimally dependent on datasheets, featuring a good compromise between accuracy and costs.}

    abstract    = {In recent years, an enormous amount of research has been carried out on support vector machines (SVMs) and their application in several fields of science. SVMs are one of the most powerful and robust classification and regression algorithms in multiple fields of application. The SVM has been playing a significant role in pattern recognition which is an extensively popular and active research area among the researchers. Research in some fields where SVMs do not perform well has spurred development of other applications such as SVM for large data sets, SVM for multi classification and SVM for unbalanced data sets. Further, SVM has been integrated with other advanced methods such as evolve algorithms, to enhance the ability of classification and optimize parameters. SVM algorithms have gained recognition in research and applications in several scientific and engineering areas. This paper provides a brief introduction of SVMs, describes many applications and summarizes
                  challenges and trends. Furthermore, limitations of SVMs will be identified. The future of SVMs will be discussed in conjunction with further applications. The applications of SVMs will be reviewed as well, especially in the some fields.}

    abstract    = {This paper addresses the problem of finding a stationary point of a nonlinear dynamical system whose state variables are under inequality constraints. Systems of this type often arise from the discretization of PDEs that model physical phenomena (e.g., fluid dynamics) in which the state variables are under realizability constraints (e.g., positive pressure and density). We start from the popular pseudo-transient continuation method and augment it with nonlinear inequality constraints. The constraint handling technique does not help in situations where no steady-state solution exists, for example, because of an under-resolved discretization of PDEs. However, an often overlooked situation is one in which the steady-state solution exists but cannot be reached by the solver, which typically fails because of the violation of constraints, that is, a non-physical state error during state iterations. This is the shortcoming that we address by incorporating physical
                  realizability constraints into the solution path from the initial condition to steady state. Although we focus on the DG method applied to fluid dynamics, our technique relies only on implicit time marching and hence can be extended to other spatial discretizations and other physics problems. We analyze the sensitivity of the method to a range of input parameters and present results for compressible turbulent flows that show that the constrained method is significantly more robust than a standard unconstrained method while on par in terms of cost.

    abstract    = {For flexible hydrofoils, the natural flow-induced bending and twisting deformations are coupled if the center of lift is away from the elastic axis; this coupling may be influenced by viscous effects due to movement in the center of lift. The objective of this work is to investigate the role of flow-induced bend--twist coupling effects, as well as their dependence on the reduced velocity and solid-to-fluid added mass ratio. A secondary objective is to compare inviscid and viscous fluid--structure interaction (FSI) simulations of the natural flow-induced vibration responses of flexible cantilevered hydrofoils in water. The focus is on attached flow conditions in fully turbulent regimes at low angles of attack, where inviscid FSI method should be relatively accurate, and the foil response should be dominated by the foil's natural frequencies. The viscous FSI model is formulated by coupling a two-dimensional (2D) unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (URANS) model
                  with a two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) model representing the spanwise tip bending and twisting deformations. The results show that the flow-induced bend--twist coupling terms are important for accurate prediction of the natural vibration frequencies and damping characteristics, particularly for the twisting motion, and their relative importance grows when the relative velocity increases and the solid-to-fluid added mass ratio decreases.}

The system consists of two main parts: a neural network-based face detection arbitrator, and a search strategy based on an integer-handling DIRECT algorithm. By the architecture, the number of arbitrations is dramatically reduced, and human faces, if they are present in an image, are not restricted to predetermined resolutions and aspect ratios. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture is efficient in terms of both speed and robustness.}

    abstract    = {There are two major types of approaches that are used for the multidisciplinary analysis (MDA) of coupled systems: fixed-point-iteration-based approaches and coupled Newton-based approaches. Fixed-point-iteration approaches are easier to implement, but can require a large number of iterations or diverge for strongly coupled problems. On the other hand, coupled-Newton approaches have superior convergence orders, but generally require more effort to implement and have more expensive iterations. Additionally, these two major approaches have many variations, including hybrid approaches where the MDA begins with a fixed-point iteration and then switches to a coupled-Newton approach after a certain number of iterations. However, there is a lack of criteria to govern how to select between these approaches, and when to switch between them in a hybrid approach. This paper compares these approaches and provides an algorithm that can be used to automatically select and switch
                  between them. The proposed algorithm is implemented using OpenMDAO, NASA's open-source framework for multidisciplinary analysis and optimization, and is tested using OpenAeroStruct, an open-source low-fidelity tool for aerostructural optimization. The results show that the proposed algorithm provides a balance of improved robustness and speed.}

In this work, we use simplified models for the aerodynamics, propulsion, propeller--wing flow interaction, and flight mechanics to carry out gradient-based optimization studies for the takeoff-to-cruise trajectory of a tandem tilt-wing eVTOL aircraft. We present results for optimizations with and without stall and acceleration constraints, with varying levels of flow augmentation from propellers, and find that the optimal takeoffs involve stalling the wings or flying near the stall angle of attack. However, we find that the energy penalty for avoiding stall is practically negligible. Additionally, we find that without acceleration constraints, the optimized trajectories involve rapidly
                  transitioning to forward flight and accelerating, followed by climbing at roughly constant speed, and then accelerating to the required cruise speed. With an acceleration constraint for passenger comfort, the transition, climb, and acceleration phases are more gradual and less distinct. We also present results showing the impact of wing loading and available power on the optimized trajectories.}

Considering propeller--wing interaction provides the opportunity to design aircraft that take advantage of aerodynamic benefits through propulsion integration. In this paper, the cruise drag of a wing with an inboard-mounted tractor propeller is minimized using aerodynamic shape optimization. Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes computational fluid dynamics with an actuator-disk approach is used for the simulations, and a gradient-based algorithm is used for the optimization. Changing the rotation direction of the propeller and optimizing the twist and airfoil shapes of the wing impact the aerodynamic performance significantly. However, optimizing the wing while considering the propeller slipstream provides little additional benefit compared to optimizing it without considering the propeller slipstream (the
                  difference is less than one drag count). The wings optimized without considering the propeller slipstream are naturally able to recover swirl almost as effectively as the wings optimized while considering the propeller slipstream, and the propeller-induced velocities for the cruise condition are not high enough to lead to significant airfoil-shape design changes.}

    abstract    = {Wing shape is one of the main drivers of aircraft aerodynamic performance, so most aerodynamic shape optimization efforts have focused solely on the wing. However, the performance of the full aircraft configuration must account for the fact that the aircraft needs to be trimmed. Thus, to realize the full benefit of aerodynamic shape optimization, one should optimize the wing shape while including the full configuration and a trim constraint. To evaluate the benefit of this approach, we perform the aerodynamic shape optimization of the Common Research Model wing--body--tail configuration using gradient-based optimization with a Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes model that includes a discrete adjoint implementation. We investigate the aerodynamic shape optimization of the wing with a trim constraint that is satisfied by rotating the horizontal tail. We then optimize the same wing--body configuration without the tail but with an added trim drag penalty based on a
                  surrogate model we created before the optimization. The drag coefficient is minimized subject to lift and trim constraints. We found that considering the trim during optimization is a better approach than using a fixed-wing moment constraint. We also show that the trim drag surrogate model we created yields a minimum drag coefficient that is within 1.2 counts of the minimum drag coefficient obtained by rotating the tail to satisfy the trim constraint. However, we recommend rotating the tail within the optimization process to obtain the best possible performance.

The optimization constraints may involve outputs that are not directly targeted for optimization, and hence also not for error estimation and mesh adaptation. However, discretization errors in these outputs often indirectly affect the calculation of the objective function. The proposed method takes this effect into account, so that the mesh is adapted and itself optimized to predict both objective outputs and constraint outputs with appropriate accuracy. We use unstructured mesh optimization to maximize accuracy of the results for a given number of degrees of freedom. The error estimates drive a multifidelity optimization process, preventing over-optimization on a coarse mesh and over-refinement on an undesired design. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method on
                  several airfoil shape optimization problems governed by the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The framework is expected to be even more important for optimization problems with complex systems, dramatic design changes, or high-accuracy requirements.}

    abstract    = {Designing floating offshore wind turbine system is a quite challenging task because of the complex environmental loading and complicated coupling effects. In the present study, the fully coupled aero-hydrodynamic model for numerical simulation of floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) is established with open source tool OpenFOAM. The coupled FOWT-UALM-SJTU solver is developed using the open source CFD package OpenFOAM, in which the unsteady actuator line model (UALM) is introduced into OpenFOAM for the aerodynamic simulation of wind turbine, while the hydrodynamic computation of floating platform is carried out with a two-phase CFD solver naoe-FOAM-SJTU. In the coupled model, the three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are solved with the turbulence model k-ω SST employed for closure of RANS equations, and the Pressure-Implicit with Splitting of Operations (PISO) algorithm is applied to solve the pressure-velocity coupling equations. The
                  coupled responses of a FOWT with NREL-5MW baseline wind turbine mounted on a semi-submersible platform are investigated. From the simulation, aerodynamic forces including the unsteady aerodynamic power and thrust can be obtained, and hydrodynamic responses such as the six-degree-of-freedom motions of the floating platform and the mooring tensions are also available. The impact of dynamic motions of floating platform on the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine is analyzed, and the effect of the aerodynamic forces on the hydrodynamic response of the floating platform is also studied.}

    abstract    = {Drone delivery is known as a potential contributor in improving efficiency and alleviating last-mile delivery problems. For this reason, drone routing and scheduling has become a highly active area of research in recent years. Unlike the vehicle routing problem, however, designing drones' routes is challenging due to multiple operational characteristics including multi-trip operations, recharge planning, and energy consumption calculation. To fill some important gaps in the literature, this paper solves a multi-trip drone routing problem, where drones' energy consumption is modeled as a nonlinear function of payload and travel distance. We propose adding logical cuts and subgradient cuts in the solution process to tackle the more complex nonlinear (convex) energy function, instead of using the linear approximation method as in the literature, which can fail to detect infeasible routes due to excess energy consumption. We use a 2-index formulation to model the problem
                  and develop a branch-and-cut algorithm for the formulation. Benchmark instances are first generated for this problem. Numerical tests indicate that even though the original model is nonlinear, the proposed approach can solve large problems to optimality. In addition, in multiple instances, the linear approximation model yields routes that under the nonlinear energy model would be energy infeasible. Use of a linear approximation for drone energy leads to differences in energy consumption of about 9\% on average compared to the nonlinear energy model.}

    abstract    = {An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, offers the advantage of speed, flexibility, and ease in delivering goods to customers. They are particularly useful for tasks that are dull, hazardous, or dirty. Whether the use of drone delivery is beneficial to the environment and cost saving is still a topic under debate. Ideally, drones yield lower energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing the carbon footprint and enhancing environmental sustainability. In this research, we analytically study the impact of UAVs on CO2 emission and cost. We propose a mixed-integer (0--1 linear) green routing model for UAV to exploit the sustainability aspects of the use of UAVs for last-mile parcel deliveries. A genetic algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the complex model, and an extensive experiment is conducted to illustrate and validate the analytical model and the solution algorithm. We find that optimally routing and delivering
                  packages with UAVs would save energy and reduce carbon emissions. The computational results strongly support the notion that using UAVs for last-mile logistics is not only cost effective, but also environmentally friendly.}

    abstract    = {With the emergence of new technologies for small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS), such as lightweight sensors and high-efficiency batteries, the operation of small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAVs) will expand from military use to commercial use. A promising commercial application of sUAS is package delivery because of its potential to reduce acquisition and operating costs of the last-mile delivery system, while enabling new services such as same-day delivery. Moreover, in urban areas, sUAVs can deliver packages to customers without negatively affecting street traffic. To conduct urban operations, sUAS-based delivery systems must obey regulations for sUAS operations and avoid urban obstacles. In this paper, a maximum-flight-time-constrained multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows optimization model is used to create routes for sUAS-based delivery missions. To address the actual urban environment with the optimization model, a two-layered urban flight
                  network is built by feeding an airborne light detection and ranging sensor data into an algorithm that uses a Voronoi diagram to create collision-free paths. This paper uses this approach to study a possible package delivery using sUAS in San Diego, CA.}

    abstract    = {This paper introduces an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) heterogeneous fleet routing problem, dealing with vehicles limited autonomy by considering multiple charging stations and respecting operational requirements. A green routing problem is designed for overcoming difficulties that exist as a result of limited vehicle driving range. Due to the large amount of drones emerging in the society, UAVs use and efficiency should be optimized. In particular, these kinds of vehicles have been recently used for delivering and collecting products. Here, we design a new real-time routing problem, in which different types of drones can collect and deliver packages. These aerial vehicles are able to collect more than one deliverable at the same time if it fits their maximum capacity. Inspired by a multi-criteria view of real systems, seven different objective functions are considered and sought to be minimized using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model solved by a
                  matheuristic algorithm. The latter filters the non-dominated solutions from the pool of solutions found in the branch-and-bound optimization tree, using a black-box dynamic search algorithm. A case of study, considering a bi-layer scenario, is presented in order to validate the proposal, which showed to be able to provide good quality solutions for supporting decision making.}

    abstract    = {The classical aeroelastic scaling theory used to design scaled models is based on the assumption that complete flow similarity exists between the full aircraft and the scaled model. When this condition is satisfied, the scaling problem of the model can be treated as a structural design problem only, where the scaled aerodynamic shape is preserved. If, on the other hand, this hypothesis no longer holds---if the scaled model is constrained to fly at low speed and low altitude, for example---and both the aerodynamic shape and the flexibility of the structure are exactly scaled, then the static response exhibits significant discrepancies in the aerodynamic loads and structural displacement. To design a flying demonstrator with scaled static response when flow similarity cannot be fulfilled, we present a multidisciplinary optimization-based method that allows some freedom in the design of the wing shape (while keeping the scaled wingspan) to update the wing geometry and
                  structural properties to ensure equivalent scaled loads and overall wing displacement. To illustrate this method, we apply it to a 1:5 version of the uCRM wing at subsonic flight condition. While the errors in air loads using the classical theory are around 16\%, the presented method achieves errors lower than 1\%, with a good agreement for the wingtip displacement.}

However, when trying to reproduce the behavior of an airliner that flies at transonic conditions using a scaled model that flies at nearly-incompressible flow conditions, this assumption is no longer valid and both flutter speed and static aerodynamic loading are subject to large discrepancies. To address this issue, we present an optimization-based approach for wing planform design that matches the scaled flutter speeds and modes of the reference aircraft when the Mach number cannot be matched. This is achieved by minimizing the squared error between the full-size and scaled aerodynamic models. This method is validated using the Common Research Model wing at the reference aircraft Mach number. The error in flutter speed is computed using the same
                  wing at model conditions, which are in the nearly-incompressible regime. Starting from the baseline wing, its planform is optimized to match the reference response despite different conditions, achieving a reduction of the error in the predicted flutter speed from 7.79\% to 2.13\%.}

An iterative procedure uses the previous measures to actively select the next estimation of f which is predicted to be the most useful. We focus on the case where the function can be evaluated in parallel with batches of fixed size and analyze the benefit compared to the purely sequential procedure in terms of cumulative regret. We introduce the Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound and Pure Exploration algorithm (GP-UCB-PE) which combines the UCB strategy and Pure Exploration in the same batch of evaluations along the parallel iterations. We prove theoretical upper bounds on the regret with batches of size K for this procedure which show the improvement of the order of {\$}{\backslash}sqrt{\{}K{\}}{\$}for fixed iteration cost over purely sequential versions. Moreover, the multiplicative constants involved have the property
                  of being dimension-free. We also confirm empirically the efficiency of GP-UCB-PE on real and synthetic problems compared to state-of-the-art competitors.}

The second order finite volume method (FVM) has been shown to satisfy these constraints when using a sufficiently fine mesh. However, during aerodynamic shape optimization, there are large geometry and flow solution changes that can lead to a decrease in solution accuracy over the course of the optimization. If the solution loses accuracy, the optimizer can find a spurious optimum. The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method yields high-order accurate solutions that have less discretization error. However, the higher accuracy comes at a higher computational cost, so the advantage of DG is not always clear. DG is suitable for both local order and mesh refinement which can allow it to be more accurate per degree of freedom than the FVM. In this work we show the benefits of using DG over FVM for optimization. We also develop a strategy for p-adaptation during optimization that
                  reduces computational cost and obtains the same optimum as a fine-space solution.}

High-order simulations require meshes with faces that are curved to represent the geometry. Traditionally, curved meshes are made linear and then adapted and re-curved at the end of the adaptation process. However, for complex geometries the mesh curving procedure can fail or be computationally expensive. The mesh adaptation procedure presented here utilizes existing edge primitive operations for mesh adaptation methods and extends them to high-order meshes. Our method keeps the mesh valid and curved during the entire adaptation process leading to a more robust mesh adaptation. Results for four test cases demonstrate the ability of this method to produce valid curved meshes with a variety of different aspect ratio. The output error convergence for these cases is comparable to a global re-meshing strategy. This work is a step forward for automated, robust, and accurate
                  high-order computational fluid dynamics simulations.}

Kriging is a popular surrogate modelling technique for data based on deterministic computer experiments. There exist several types of Kriging, mostly differing in the type of regression function used. Recently a promising new variable selection technique was proposed to identify a regression function in the Kriging framework. In this paper this type of Kriging, i.e., blind Kriging, has been efficiently implemented in Matlab{\textregistered} and has been extended. The implementation is validated and tested on several examples to illustrate the strength and weaknesses of this new, promising modelling technique. It is shown that the performance of blind Kriging is as good as, or better than ordinary Kriging. Though, blind Kriging
                  comes at double the computational cost with respect to ordinary Kriging.}

    abstract    = {Radial basis function interpolation is often employed in mesh deformation algorithms for unstructured meshes, for example in fluid--structure interaction or design optimization problems. This is known to be a robust methodology that results in high quality deformed meshes. The applicability of this method to large problems is currently hampered by its prohibitive computational cost, however, which is caused by the need to solve a dense system of equations. The computation time grows as O(Nb3) if a direct solver is employed for the solution (where Nb denotes the number of boundary nodes in the mesh), while alternative iterative solvers often suffer from an unfavorable convergence behavior. In this paper, we present the inverse fast multipole method as a novel fast approximate direct solver with a computational cost scaling as O(Nb). The linear complexity is achieved by transforming the dense system into an extended sparse system, along with the compression of certain
                  matrix blocks into low-rank factorizations. The solver is inexact, although the error can be controlled and made as small as needed; a low accuracy solver can hence be used as an efficient preconditioner in an iterative scheme. Numerical benchmarks are presented, demonstrating that the proposed approach enhances the computational efficiency of mesh deformation algorithms based on radial basis function interpolation significantly, without jeopardizing their robustness and quality.}

Next, we introduce a tax- onomy and review recent contributions in UAV trajectory optimisation, UAV routing and articles addressing these problems, and their variants, simultaneously. We conclude with the identification of future research op- portunities.}

    abstract    = {The conceptual design of aircraft often entails a large number of nonlinear constraints that result in a nonconvex feasible design space and multiple local optima. The design of the high-speed civil transport (HSCT) is used as an example of a highly complex conceptual design with 26 design variables and 68 constraints. This paper compares three global optimization techniques on the HSCT problem and two test problems containing thousands of local optima and noise: multistart local optimizations using either sequential quadratic programming (SQP) as implemented in the design optimization tools (DOT) program or Snyman's dynamic search method, and a modified form of Jones' DIRECT global optimization algorithm. SQP is a local optimizer, while Snyman's algorithm is capable of moving through shallow local minima. The modified DIRECT algorithm is a global search method based on Lipschitzian optimization that locates small promising regions of design space and then uses a
                  local optimizer to converge to the optimum. DOT and the dynamic search algorithms proved to be superior for finding a single optimum masked by noise of trigonometric form. The modified DIRECT algorithm was found to be better for locating the global optimum of functions with many widely separated true local optima.}

Their growing use has risen from their high specific strength and stiffness, when compared to the more conventional materials, and the ability to shape and tailor their structure to produce more aerodynamically efficient structural configurations. In this paper, a review of recent advances using composites in modern aircraft construction is presented and it is argued that fibre reinforced polymers, especially carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) can and will in the future contribute more than 50\% of the structural mass of an aircraft. However, affordability is the key to survival in aerospace manufacturing, whether civil or
                  military, and therefore effort should be devoted to analysis and computational simulation of the manufacturing and assembly process as well as the simulation of the performance of the structure, since they are intimately connected.}

    abstract    = {Conceptual aircraft design directly impacts the structure of an airline's route network and ability to service demand for various ticket itineraries between origin and destination city pairs. The decisions made in allocating new aircraft to serve predicted future demand of various ticket itineraries affects an airline's risk and profit potential. Therefore, choices on the selection of target market travel itineraries to be served and design requirements of new, yet- to-be-introduced aircraft directly govern the tradeoff of risk against potential profit. This paper presents a concurrent engineering strategy for an airline that wishes to investigate the impact that aircraft design choices and target market capture decisions have on tradeoffs between expected profit and risk in serving particular demand itineraries. The approach considers the integrated domains of aircraft design, airline operations, and passenger demand within the context of a mathematical programming
                  problem. More specifically, innovations are leveraged in a robust modern portfolio optimization that addresses issues of uncertainties in estimated measures of risk and reward and concurrent engineering techniques from multidisciplinary design optimization to provide integrated aircraft design solutions. The framework is first illustrated with a simple eight-city network problem where a conceptual airline seeks to identify the optimal target market capture for various demand itineraries and select an aircraft that can best maximize profits at a specified tolerance of risk from a candidate list of aircraft designs. This is then extended to the more general case of designing an aircraft under the same conditions.}

    abstract    = {The rise in interest in large foiling yachts, such as those in the America's Cup, has spurred a corresponding interest in foiling applications in monohull sailing dinghies, both for boats designed specifically for foiling, and through retro-fit foil kits. The present study considers the assessment of foil systems for such boats, and specifically the prediction of the necessary foil performance of T-foils with flaps. The main lifting foil for a moth dinghy with flap was tested at full-scale in a towing tank at a range of speeds, trim angles and flap angles, and immersions, to measure vertical and lift and drag. Results are then compared with two simplified models typical of those utilized in Velocity Prediction Programs for preliminary design. The first model uses section lift and drag data obtained using the well-known XFOIL code allied to a simple correction for 3D effects while the second model deploys a numerical lifting line theory in conjunction with section
                  data. A number of practical conclusions are drawn regarding the set-up and sailing of foiling dinghies with flapped T-foils. Results show that whilst the simple and rapid models typically used in basic VPPs may not accurately represent the relationships between angle of attack / flap angle with lift and drag, the predicted relation between lift and drag is reasonably accurate in most cases.}

    abstract    = {The Mission-Adaptive Wing (MAW) employs composite materials and uses a digital fly-by-wire flight control system to change wing contour to maintain peak aerodynamic efficiency over a large flight envelope. Future aircraft will require large subsonic and supersonic lift-to-drag ratios for maximum cruise ranges at high and low altitudes. At the same time, they will require the ability to pull high lift coefficients for maneuvers. The Mission-Adaptive Wing provides these Features by deflecting flexible wing surfaces to achieve the wing camber and smooth continuous upper surface contour required for peak aerodynamic performance. The MAW program completed manual control flight testing in November 1986 and started automatic control flight testing in the summer of 1987. During the manual phase of flight testing, surfaces were set in discrete positions. Resulting data confirmed the aerodynamic potential to achieve all program goals. The automatic control phase will test four
                  modes designed to increase range, maneuverability, and operational flexibility without affecting pilot workload. }

The application of a systemic approach provides better design performance and the possibility to rapidly assess the effect of changes in the requirements. This paper proposes a generic and efficient sizing methodology for electric multirotor vehicles which allows to optimize a configuration for different missions and requirements. Starting from a set of algebraic equations based on scaling laws and similarity models, the optimization problem representing the sizing can be formulated in many manners. The proposed methodology shows a significant reduction in the number of function evaluations in the optimization process due to a thorough suppression of inequality constraints when compared to initial problem formulation. The results are validated by comparison to characteristics
                  of existing multirotors. In addition, performance predictions of these configurations are performed for different flight scenarios and payloads.}

One of the four benchmark test cases is based on the NACA 0012 airfoil and solutions of the Euler equations with prescribed objective function and geometric constaints. Volunteer participants were invited by ONERA--The French Aerospace Lab to submit their optimized shapes for uniform pressure drag assessment through grid convergence. The assessment required three phases. Initial investigations with a simple protocol proved insufficient and raised some questions. This led to further investigations, which showed that, for most optimized airfoils, there exists a lower drag branch and a higher drag branch in the drag (Mach number) diagram. Hysteresis was observed when performing a downward Mach number sweep and an upward Mach number sweep. For several airfoils, the design Mach number falls within the overlap range
                  of the two branches, which indicates that two solutions may exist for the same airfoil. Two kinds of supersonic flow structure can be distinguished. One kind produces a lower drag branch and the other a higher drag branch. The jump from one branch to the other involves nonsymmetrical converged solutions. These further investigations required a final assessment, where a protocol was instituted to ensure that the lower drag branch was captured by taking advantage of the hysteresis. However, nonuniqueness may confound an optimization algorithm because the same set of design variables can give two different objective function values. }

    abstract    = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is increasingly used to analyze wind turbines, and the next logical step is to develop CFD-based optimization to enable further gains in performance and reduce model uncertainties. We present an aerodynamic shape optimization framework consisting of a Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes solver coupled to a numerical optimization algorithm, a geometry modeler, and a mesh perturbation algorithm. To efficiently handle the large number of design variables, we use a gradient-based optimization technique together with an adjoint method for computing the gradients of the torque coefficient with respect to the design variables. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we maximize the torque of the NREL VI wind turbine blade with respect to pitch, twist, and airfoil shape design variables while constraining the blade thickness. We present a series of optimization cases with increasing number of variables, both for a single wind
                  speed and for multiple wind speeds. For the optimization at a single wind speed performed with respect to all the design variables (1 pitch, 11 twist, and 240 airfoil shape variables), the torque coefficient increased by 22.4\% relative to the NREL VI design. For the multiple-speed optimization, the torque increased by an average of 22.1\%. Depending on the CFD mesh size and number of design variables, the optimization time ranges from 2 to 24h when using 256 cores, which means that wind turbine designers can use this process routinely.}

To this purpose, an improved Dividing RECTangles (DIRECT) algorithm is proposed to substitute for the commonly used grid search method. The proposed global optimization algorithm can provide initial estimates for local optimization algorithms such as Newton and Simplex. Based on classical DIRECT algorithm, the improved version, called Lipschitz constant assisted DIRECT (L-DIRECT) Algorithm, eliminates hopeless areas, suspends unlikely areas, and concentrates on more promising areas in search space, finding the range of attraction (ROA) with lower SNR threshold or less computational burden for local optimization algorithms. The effect of the modification is validated by simulation results.}

In a preceding paper, we proposed an exact penalty algorithm for constrained problems which combines an unconstrained global minimization technique for minimizing a non-differentiable exact penalty function for given values of the penalty parameter, and an automatic updating of the penalty parameter that occurs only a finite number of times. However, in the updating of the penalty parameter, the method requires the evaluation of the derivatives of the problem functions. In this work, we show that an efficient updating can be implemented also without using the problem derivatives, in this way making the approach suitable for globally solving constrained problems where the derivatives are not available. In the algorithm, any efficient derivative-free unconstrained global minimization technique can be used. In particular, we adopt an improved version of the DIRECT algorithm. In
                  addition, to improve the performances, the approach is enriched by resorting to derivative-free local searches, in a multistart framework. In this context, we prove that, under suitable assumptions, for every global minimum point there exists a neighborhood of attraction for the local search. An extensive numerical experience is reported.}

To solve this problem we propose the combined use of a DIRECT-type algorithm with a derivative-free local minimization of a nonsmooth exact penalty function. In particular, we define a new DIRECT-type strategy to explore the search space by explicitly taking into account the two-fold nature of the optimization problems, i.e. the global optimization of both the objective function and of a feasibility measure. We report an extensive experimentation on hard test problems to show viability of the approach.}

    abstract    = {Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, have the potential to significantly reduce the cost and time of making last-mile deliveries and responding to emergencies. Despite this potential, little work has gone into developing vehicle routing problems (VRPs) specifically for drone delivery scenarios. Existing VRPs are insufficient for planning drone deliveries: either multiple trips to the depot are not permitted, leading to solutions with excess drones, or the effect of battery and payload weight on energy consumption is not considered, leading to costly or infeasible routes. We propose two multitrip VRPs for drone delivery that address both issues. One minimizes costs subject to a delivery time limit, while the other minimizes the overall delivery time subject to a budget constraint. We mathematically derive and experimentally validate an energy consumption model for multirotor drones, demonstrating that energy consumption varies approximately linearly with payload and
                  battery weight. We use this approximation to derive mixed integer linear programs for our VRPs. We propose a cost function that considers our energy consumption model and drone reuse, and apply it in a simulated annealing (SA) heuristic for finding suboptimal solutions to practical scenarios. To assist drone delivery practitioners with balancing cost and delivery time, the SA heuristic is used to show that the minimum cost has an inverse exponential relationship with the delivery time limit, and the minimum overall delivery time has an inverse exponential relationship with the budget. Numerical results confirm the importance of reusing drones and optimizing battery size in drone delivery VRPs.}

    abstract    = {An interactive design and optimization framework for the development of multielement airfoils is presented. A zonal Euler/Boundary-layer flow solver is used as the underlying analysis method. The full Newton solution method of the solver permits effectively 'free" calculation of flowfield sen- sitivities to predefined airfoil element shape deformation modes, and also to rigid-body element translation and ro- tation modes. The sensitivity of any aerodynamic quantity of interest, including drag, to all the geometric parameters is thus obtained. Single-point and multi-point optimiza- tion and least-squares inverse techniques are constructed with the sensitivity information. Aerodynamic and geomet- ric constraints are also readily incorporated. The method's ability to economically incorporate many design variables into interactively-specified design and/or optimization prob lems makes it particularly effective in multielement airfoil development. Applications are
                  presented for: 1) Multi-point optimiza- tion of a novel two-element transonic cruise airfoil with a thickness constraint, and 2) CLmax optimization of a four- element landing configuration airfoil.}

Surrogate-based analysis tools are applied to simulation data to construct educed-order models, which are in turn used to perform global sensitivity analysis to compare the relative importance of cathode properties. Based on these results, the cell is then optimized for several distinct physical scenarios using gradient-based methods. The complementary nature of the gradient- and surrogate-based tools is demonstrated by establishing proper bounds and constraints with the surrogate model, and then obtaining accurate optimized solutions with the gradient-based optimizer. These optimal solutions enable the quantification of the tradeoffs between energy and power density, and the effect of
                  optimizing the electrode thickness and porosity. In conjunction with known guidelines, the numerical optimization framework developed herein can be applied directly to cell and pack design.}

    abstract    = {Aerodynamic optimization based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a powerful design approach because it significantly reduces the design time compared with the human manual design. However, CFD-based optimization can still take hours to converge because it requires repeatedly running computationally expensive flow simulations. To further shorten the design optimization time, we propose a fast, interactive design framework that allows us to complete an airfoil aerodynamic optimization within a few seconds. This framework is made efficient through a B-spline-based generative adversarial network model for shape parameterization, which filters out unrealistic airfoils for a reduced design space that contains all relevant airfoil shapes. Moreover, we use a combination of multilayer perceptron, recurrent neural networks, and mixture of experts for surrogate modeling to enable both scalar (drag and lift) and vector (pressure distribution) response predictions for a
                  wide range of Mach numbers (0.3 to 0.7) and Reynolds numbers (104 to 1010). To verify our proposed framework, we compare the optimization results with the ones computed by direct CFD-based optimization for subsonic and transonic conditions. The results show that the optimal designs and the aerodynamic quantities (lift, drag, and pressure distribution) obtained by our proposed framework agree well with the ones computed by direct CFD-based optimizations and evaluations. The proposed framework is being integrated into a web-based interactive aerodynamic design framework that allows users to predict drag, lift, moment, pressure distribution, and optimal airfoil shapes for a wide range of flow conditions within seconds.}

    abstract    = {Effective access to aerodynamic flow fields reveals essential physical insights (such as shock waves and boundary layer separation) related to aerodynamic efficiency. Thus, an adequate description on flows fields is advantageous for airfoil design optimization with reference to achieving desirable aerodynamic performance. Conventional flow field computation, however, relies on high-fidelity but time-consuming computational fluid dynamics models. Alternatively, surrogate modeling (such as reduced-order modeling) arises for fast flow field prediction, but randomly sampling an input space could result in intensive training data cost. To tackle these issues, in this work we propose a fully automated adaptive sampling strategy for the proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced order modeling. In particular, we leverage a mathematical sampling criteria (known as potential) for intelligent selection among sample candidates. Moreover, we propose to select the number of
                  reduced-order bases and switch to a second strategy on the fly, instead of user-defined and fixed throughout the whole process. Therefore, "fully automated" refers to the fact that the sampling strategy exerts fully automated control over the adaptive selection to the samples and bases. We demonstrated the proposed sampling strategy on airfoil flow field prediction within transonic regime in this work. Results showed that the surrogate predictions based on random sampling via Latin hypercube sampling had a error of 1.6E−3 over the input space of Mach number ([0.55, 0.75]) and angle of attack ([-1, 3] deg). In contrast, the fully automated strategy made a mean error of 7.69E−4 and a small standard deviation of 5.72E−5 over the input space for 10 different trials. The worst predictive performance has an error of 8.01E−4. Furthermore, we compared the fully automated strategy against the fix-switch strategy. The mean error of fixed-switch strategy varies from
                  6.83E−4 to 8.01E−4 depending on when to switch to the second strategy. The worst predictive performance has an error up to 1.4E−3. Note that we set 40 training samples as the total computational budget and compared predictive performance under this condition. Therefore, we can conclude the fully automated algorithm has promising predictive performance with sufficient robustness with respect to sample candidate pools. Note that the proposed strategy is also extensible to other engineering fields.}

    abstract    = {For the minimum drag at desired flight requirements, aerodynamic optimization plays an important role in automating the aircraft design process. Specifically, existing optimization approaches commonly adopt derivative-free algorithms for low-dimensional design space, while gradient-based algorithms enabled by adjoint methods alleviate computational expenses of large-scale designs. However, repeatedly evaluating simulation models results in the fact that conventional optimizations still rely on high-performance computing clusters. Consequently, with the development of machine learning and deep learning emerge surrogate models in lieu of computationally intensive simulation models. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal design concept, namely, learning the mapping directly from design requirements to the optimal designs through neural network surrogates. Thus, the trained surrogate model directly predicts optimal designs with no need to run any optimizations.
                  Considering the complex mapping and costly training data (one training sample corresponds to one simulation-based optimization), we first exploited the low-rank representation of the output space, i.e., optimal designs. Moreover, we developed the multi-fidelity version of the reduced-dimensional neural networks to reduce the computational cost even further. Results revealed that the reduced-dimensional neural networks achieved 95% predictive accuracy on the optimal designs using 120 high-fidelity training samples while full-space networks required 140. In addition, when provided with very few data (such as 20), reduced-dimensional networks increased the predictive accuracy by more than 5%. Furthermore, the multi-fidelity reduced-dimensional networks achieved 95% accuracy using 80 high-fidelity and 40 low-fidelity samples, computationally equal to 82 high-fidelity samples, making it 31.7% reduction on the computational cost.}

This paper proposes a design approach for structural optimization with uncertain but bounded loads. The problem of identifying critical loads is formulated mathematically as an optimization problem in itself (called anti-optimization), so that the design problem is formulated as a two-level optimization. For linear structural analysis it is shown that the antioptimization part is limited to consideration of the vertices of the load-uncertainty domain. An example of a ten-bar truss is used to demonstrate that we cannot replace the anti-optimization process by considering the largest possible loads.}

    abstract    = {Propeller-wing configurations are expected to return to the aviation industry due to their high propulsive efficiency and applicability in urban and regional air mobility. A knowledge gap exists around wing-propeller optimization because of the complexity of the propeller-wing system and the absence of a computationally efficient way to assess the coupled system. This paper addresses this gap by providing and validating a computationally efficient, mid-fidelity framework. The paper presents optimization results and recommendations for future iterations of the framework. The TU Delft PROWIM propeller is optimized with the framework, comparing sequential isolated optimization, trim optimization, and fully coupled optimization. The studies gives a conservative estimate of the efficiency gains that can be achieved by using coupled optimization, as compared to isolated optimization. Lastly, recommendations are given for future studies, such as including a battery weight
                  model and including swirl velocities. It is expected that such model additions will affect the optimization results, and further emphasize the importance of coupled aerostructural optimization. }

    abstract    = {Discrete multi-load truss sizing optimization (MTSO) problems are challenging to solve due to their combinatorial, nonlinear, and non-convex nature. This study highlights two important characteristics of the feasible set of MTSO problems considered here, in which force balance equations, Hooke's law, yield stress, bound constraints on displacements, and local bucking are taken into account. Namely, we use the linear or bilinear nature of the problem to take advantage of re-scaling properties of both the problem's design and auxiliary variables, as well as to extend the superposition principle to the case in which nonlinear stress constraints are considered. Taking advantage of these characteristics, we extend the neighborhood search mixed-integer linear optimization (NS-MILO) method (Shahabsafa et al. in SMO 63: 21--38, 2018), which provides an effective heuristic solution approach based on exact solution methods for MILO problems. Through extensive computational
                  experiments, we demonstrate that the extended NS-MILO method provides high-quality solutions for large-scale discrete MTSO problems in a reasonable time.}

    abstract    = {Failure in brittle materials under dynamic loading conditions is a result of the propagation and coalescence of microcracks. Simulating this discrete crack evolution at the continuum level is computationally expensive or, in some cases, intractable, resulting in the need to make broad assumptions or neglect key physics. We have developed an approach using machine learning that overcomes the current inability to represent meso-scale physics at the macro-scale. Our approach leverages damage and stress data from a computationally expensive high-fidelity model that explicitly resolves microcrack behavior to build an inexpensive machine learning emulator. Once trained, the machine learning emulator is used to predict the evolution of crack length statistics, which then informs a continuum-scale constitutive model. This results in a significant speed-up of the workflow by four orders of magnitude. Both the machine learning emulator and the continuum-scale model are
                  validated against the high-fidelity model and experimental data, respectively, showing excellent agreement. There are two key findings. The first is that we can reduce the dimensionality of the problem, establishing that the machine learning emulator only needs the length of the longest crack and one of the maximum stress components to capture the necessary physics. Another compelling finding is that the emulator can be trained in one experimental setting and transferred successfully to predict behavior in a different setting.}

    abstract    = {We present a p-multigrid solution algorithm for a high-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization of the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. The algorithm employs an element line Jacobi smoother in which lines of elements are formed using coupling based on a p=0 discretization of the scalar convection--diffusion equation. Fourier analysis of the two-level p-multigrid algorithm for convection--diffusion shows that element line Jacobi presents a significant improvement over element Jacobi especially for high Reynolds number flows and stretched grids. Results from inviscid and viscous test cases demonstrate optimal hp+1 order of accuracy as well as p-independent multigrid convergence rates, at least up to p=3. In addition, for the smooth problems considered, p-refinement outperforms h-refinement in terms of the time required to reach a desired high accuracy level.}

    abstract    = {Electric and hybrid-electric propulsion systems are key technologies for sustainable aviation. Electric propulsion systems introduce many design possibilities, which must be considered in the conceptual design stage to take full advantage of electrification. This makes for a challenging conceptual design problem. Architecture optimization can be applied to explore large design spaces and au tomatically find the best architectures for a set of requirements. Electric propulsion architecture optimization requires automated and flexible propulsion system modeling. It also requires the analysis of the propulsion architecture at an aircraft level to compute a meaningful objective function for the optimization. In this study, we present an approach for defining the propulsion system architectures and evaluating their aircraft-level performance. A propulsion architecture is defined using a modular interface, allowing architectures to be automatically evaluated on the
                  aircraft-level for a predefined mission. OpenConcept, an open source conceptual design and optimization toolkit, is used to implement the multidisciplinary problem. We present a case study of the electrification of a regional transport aircraft Beechcraft King Air C90GT with automated definition, integration and evaluation of five different propulsion systems. We perform multidisciplinary design optimization to minimize fuel burn and maximum takeoff weight for a sweep of design ranges and battery specific energies. Our approach opens the door to electric propulsion architecture optimization.}

    abstract    = {An intuitive shape parameterization and control technique suitable for high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization is presented. It relies on the principles of free-form and axial deformation, enabling thorough exploration of the design space while keeping the number of design variables manageable. Surface sensitivities to the design variables are readily available; their inclusion in a highly efficient and robust adjoint-based optimization methodology involving linearly elastic volume mesh deformation and a Newton--Krylov solver for the Euler equations is described. The flexibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through the exploratory shape optimization of a three-pronged feathered winglet, leading to a span efficiency of 1.19 under a height-to-span ratio constraint of 0.1, and an optimization of a regional jet wing at transonic speed where a winglet is allowed to develop starting from a planar wingtip extension, leading to an 18.8\% reduction in drag.}

    abstract    = {Abstract This paper introduces a new Metric Space to guide the design of advanced wind energy systems and hydrokinetic energy converters such as tidal, ocean current and riverine turbines. The Metric Space can analyse farms that combine different or identical turbines and stand-alone turbines. The first metric (M1) of the space considers the efficiency of the turbines in the farm, which is also proportional to the specific power per swept area at a given wind/water velocity (W/m2). The second metric (M2) describes the specific rotor area per unit of mass of the turbines (m2/kg). Both metrics depend on the primary design characteristics of the turbines, such as swept area, system size and mass, materials and efficiency, and are independent at first from external characteristics, such as atmospheric and ocean site conditions, cost of materials and economic factors. Combining both metrics, and for a given set of external characteristics, the resulting Metric Space M2/M1
                  displays the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) standards as isolines. This graphical representation provides a quick understanding of the cost and state of the technology. It also offers a practical guidance to choose the research tasks and strategy to design advanced wind and hydrokinetic energy systems. The paper applies the new Metric Space to several case studies, including large and small onshore wind turbines, floating and bottom-fixed offshore wind turbines, downwind rotors, multi-rotor and hybrid systems, airborne wind energy systems, wind farms and tidal energy converters.}

    abstract    = {The design optimization of flexible hydrofoils and propellers requires coupled hydrodynamic and structural analysis to achieve truly optimal, physically realizable, and structurally sound designs. To address this need, we develop an efficient high-fidelity hydrostructural design optimization approach that can handle large numbers of design variables, multiple design points, as well as design constraints on cavitation, maximum von Mises stress, and manufacturing tolerances. The hydrostructural solver couples a 3-D nearly incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes solver with a 3-D structural finite-element solver. We validate the solver by comparing the hydrodynamic load coefficients and tip bending deformations of a cantilevered aluminum alloy hydrofoil with a NACA 0009 cross section and a trapezoidal planform. We use a coupled adjoint approach for efficient computation of the performance and constraint function derivatives with respect to 210 shape design
                  variables. A single-point hydrostructural optimization of the NACA 0009 baseline hydrofoil yields a 12.4\% increase in lift-to-drag ratio, a 2.5\% reduction in mass, and a 45\% increase in the cavitation inception speed. However, the performance of the single-point optimized hydrofoil is found to be worse than the baseline at off-design conditions. On the other hand, a multipoint optimization yields improved performance over the entire range of expected operating conditions with a weighted average increase in lift-to-drag ratio of 8.5\%, and an increased cavitation inception speed of 38\%. We compare the hydrostructural optimal result to an equivalent hydrodynamic-only optimization, and we show that only the hydrostructural optimized design satisfies the stress constraint up to the highest expected loading condition, highlighting the need for coupled hydrostructural optimization. The proposed approach enables multipoint optimization of hydrodynamic performance for
                  hydrofoils and marine propulsors with respect to detailed shape while enforcing design constraints. This constitutes a powerful new tool for improving existing designs, and exploring new concepts.}

    abstract    = {In the last decade, there has been an increased interest in the use of multidisciplinary optimization techniques for the design of aerospace, maritime, and wind engineering systems. However, validation of numerically optimized results using experimental measurements has been scarce. In this paper, numerical predictions are compared with experimental measurements of the hydrodynamic forces, deformations, and cavitation performance for a baseline NACA 0009 hydrofoil and an optimized hydrofoil. Both hydrofoils are made of solid aluminum, and are cantilevered at the root. One of the hydrofoils is optimized using a high-fidelity hydrostructural solver combined with a gradient-based optimizer, as detailed by Garg et al. (2017). The numerical predictions agree well with experimental measurements for both the baseline NACA 0009 and the optimized hydrofoils. For the optimized hydrofoil, the mean differences between the predicted and measured values for mean lift, drag
                  coefficient, and moment coefficients, are 2.9\%, 5.1\%, and 3.0\%, respectively. For the non-dimensional tip bending deflection, the mean difference is 3.4\%. Although the optimized hydrofoil is significantly thicker to withstand higher loads than the baseline, it yields an overall measured increase in the lift-to-drag ratio of 29\% for lift coefficients ranging from to 0.75 and exhibits significantly delayed cavitation inception compared to the baseline. The improvement in hydroelastic and cavitation performance is attributed to the changes in the distribution of camber, twist, thickness, and the leading edge radius of the optimized hydrofoil. The results validate the analysis and optimization of the high-fidelity hydrostructural design optimization approach, and opens up new possibilities for the design of high-performance hydrofoils, marine propellers, and turbines.}

We derive the EM algorithm and give an overview of fundamental concepts in graphical models, and inference algorithms on graphs. This is followed by a quick tour of approximate Bayesian inference, including Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Laplace approximation, BIC, variational approximations, and expectation propagation (EP).

The NBP method takes the advantage of natural property of cubic Bezier curve to generate single-valued curves which is the requirement of thickness and camber curve of an airfoil. Instead of using the coordinates of control points as parameters, the relationship between geometric properties and control point coordinates has been derived. These geometric properties are then used as design parameters, thus making the NBP more intuitive for designer. The versatility of the NBP methods is shown by fitting different categories of airfoils. A robust design optimization is then carried out to show the robustness of the method.}

    abstract    = {Within a narrow band of flight conditions in the transonic regime, interactions between shock-waves and intermittently separated shear layers result in large amplitude, self-sustained shock oscillations. This phenomenon, known as transonic shock buffet, limits the flight envelope and is detrimental to both platform handling quality and structural integrity. The severity of this instability has incited a plethora of research to ascertain an underlying physical mechanism, and yet, with over six decades of investigation, aspects of this complex phenomenon remain inexplicable. To promote continual progress in the understanding of transonic shock buffet, this review presents a consolidation of recent investigations in the field. The paper begins with a conspectus of the seminal literature on shock-induced separation and modes of shock oscillation. The currently prevailing theories for the governing physics of transonic shock buffet are then detailed. This is followed by
                  an overview of computational studies exploring the phenomenon, where the results of simulation are shown to be highly sensitive to the specific numerical methods employed. Wind tunnel investigations on two-dimensional aerofoils at shock buffet conditions are then outlined and the importance of these experiments for the development of physical models stressed. Research considering dynamic structural interactions in the presence of shock buffet is also highlighted, with a particular emphasis on the emergence of a frequency synchronisation phenomenon. An overview of three-dimensional buffet is provided next, where investigations suggest the governing mechanism may differ significantly from that of two-dimensional sections. Subsequently, a number of buffet suppression technologies are described and their efficacy in mitigating shock oscillations is assessed. To conclude, recommendations for the direction of future research efforts are given.}

    abstract    = {Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods have proved highly effective for solving constrained optimization problems with smooth nonlinear functions in the ob jective and constraints. Here we consider problems with general inequality constraints (linear and nonlinear). We assume that first derivatives are available and that the constraint gradients are sparse. We discuss an SQP algorithm that uses a smooth augmented Lagrangian merit function and makes explicit provision for infeasibility in the original problem and the QP subproblems. SNOPT is a particular implementation that makes use of a semidefinite QP solver. It is based on a limited-memory quasi-Newton approximation to the Hessian of the Lagrangian and uses a reduced-Hessian algorithm (SQOPT) for solving the QP subproblems. It is designed for problems with many thousands of constraints and variables but a moderate number of degrees of freedom (say, up to 2000). An important application is to tra jectory
                  optimization in the aerospace industry. Numerical results are given for most problems in the CUTE and COPS test collections (about 900 examples).}

    abstract    = {SNOPT is a general-purpose system for constrained optimization. It minimizes a linear or nonlinear function subject to bounds on the variables and sparse linear or nonlinear constraints. It is suitable for large-scale linear and quadratic programming and for linearly constrained optimization, as well as for general nonlinear programs. SNOPT finds solutions that are locally optimal, and ideally any nonlinear functions should be smooth and users should provide gradients. It is often more widely useful. For example, local optima are often global solutions, and discontinuities in the function gradients can often be tolerated if they are not too close to an optimum. Unknown gradients are estimated by finite differences. SNOPT uses a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm. Search directions are obtained from QP subproblems that minimize a quadratic model of the Lagrangian function subject to linearized constraints. An augmented Lagrangian merit function is
                  reduced along each search direction to ensure convergence from any starting point. On large problems, SNOPT is most efficient if only some of the variables enter nonlinearly, or there are relatively few degrees of freedom at a solution (i.e., many constraints are active). SNOPT requires relatively few evaluations of the problem functions. Hence it is especially effective if the objective or constraint functions (and their gradients) are expensive to evaluate. The source code is re-entrant and suitable for any machine with a Fortran compiler (or the f2c translator and a C compiler). SNOPT may be called from a driver program in Fortran, C, or Matlab. It can also be used as a stand-alone package, reading data in the MPS format used by commercial mathematical programming systems.}

    abstract    = {The optimization of expensive-to-evaluate functions generally relies on metamodel-based exploration strategies. Many deterministic global optimization algorithms used in the field of computer experiments are based on Kriging (Gaussian process regression). Starting with a spatial predictor including a measure of uncertainty, they proceed by iteratively choosing the point maximizing a criterion which is a compromise between predicted performance and uncertainty. Distributing the evaluation of such numerically expensive objective functions on many processors is an appealing idea. Here we investigate a multi-points optimization criterion, the multipoints expected improvement ({\$}q-{\{}{\backslash}mathbb E{\}}I{\$}), aimed at choosing several points at the same time. An analytical expression of the {\$}q-{\{}{\backslash}mathbb E{\}}I{\$}is given when q{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2, and a consistent statistical estimate is given for the general case. We then propose two
                  classes of heuristic strategies meant to approximately optimize the {\$}q-{\{}{\backslash}mathbb E{\}}I{\$}, and apply them to the classical Branin-Hoo test-case function. It is finally demonstrated within the covered example that the latter strategies perform as good as the best Latin Hypercubes and Uniform Designs ever found by simulation (2000 designs drawn at random for every q{\thinspace}∈ [1,10]).}

After a long modelling work, involving experiments in a towing tank institution, the conditions for the study of control design have been established. First experimental confirmations of the efficacy of controlled appendages have been achieved. A well tuned P.D. has been tested, with very promising results. The paper begins with a short recapitulation of the previous research. Next, the paper focus on the experiments with a replica with appendages.}

In this paper, we extend the utility of an ensemble of surrogates to (1) identify regions of possible high errors at locations where predictions of surrogates widely differ, and (2) provide a more robust approximation approach. We explore the possibility of using the best surrogate or a weighted average surrogate model instead of individual surrogate models. The weights associated with each surrogate model are determined based on the errors in surrogates. We demonstrate the advantages of an ensemble of surrogates using analytical problems and one engineering problem. We show that for a single problem the choice of test surrogate can depend on the design of experiments.}

Routes originate and terminate at the central depot and obey vehicle capacity restrictions. Typically, researchers assume that all vehicles are identical. In this work, we relax the homogeneous fleet assumption. The objective is to determine optimal fleet size and mix by minimizing a total cost function which includes fixed cost and variable cost components. We describe several efficient heuristic solution procedures as well as techniques for generating a lower bound and an underestimate of the optimal solution. Finally, we present some encouraging computational results and suggestions for further study.}

    abstract    = {Conceptual sizing and performance estimation of four vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) configurations for a package delivery mission is presented in this Paper. The multifidelity VTOL design framework HYDRA is used to size a notional quadrotor, hexarotor, quadrotor biplane tailsitter (QBiT), and a lift-augmented tricopter for weight classes of 10, 15, 20, and 25 kg. Sizing is performed using a combination of physics-based empty weight models for the airframe, rotor blades, and wings, along with statistical models for predicting motor and battery weights. A gradient-based optimization methodology was implemented to identify the best designs for each configuration under each weight class. An optimization-based longitudinal trim methodology was used to identify the appropriate shaft power settings for each vehicle at various trimmed flight conditions along the mission profile. Representative payload delivery and return scenarios were constructed from different cruise
                  speeds and ranges to identity a vehicle design in each configuration that can complete the highest number of payload drop missions successfully. The hexarotor performed better than the quadrotor in terms of requiring lower installed power and deliver heavier payload packages for a given radius of action. Wing-borne designs such as the QBiT and tricopter are capable of delivering packages in a short time owing to full/partial conversion to airplane mode during cruise flight but may require careful fine-tuning of the trimline and flight control system to successfully transition between hover and cruise flight modes.}

There is a need for more variety of composites automation and more affordable machines in the aerospace composites industry. The limited variety of automation and the cost of equipment tend to limit the spread of automation throughout the
                  aerospace composites industry. ATL and FP are composites laminating technologies that could be adapted to a wide range of machine sizes, configurations, and price ranges.Originality/value ? More widespread use of automated processes in composites would tend to lower the cost of composite aircraft structure on a global basis.}

Gradient-based optimization with derivatives computed using adjoint methods has been successful in solving aerodynamic and structural shape optimization problems but has not yet been applied to coupled propulsion--airframe optimization, partly because existing tools lack analytic derivative computation. As a step toward obtaining a full cycle analysis with efficient analytic derivative computation, a new chemical-equilibrium thermodynamics solver is developed for propulsion applications. This solver provides a continuous formulation that enables analytic derivative computation using a coupled adjoint approach. The results from this solver are verified against a well-established chemical-equilibrium code. The analytic derivatives are also verified by comparing them with finite-difference approximations. The
                  performance of the analytic derivative computations is tested using two optimizations: combustion temperature maximization with respect to equivalence ratio, and combustion temperature maximization with respect to air pressure. The results show clear speed and numerical stability benefits when comparing the proposed method against finite-difference approximations. It is now possible to use this new solver as the foundation for further development of a complete propulsion analysis for integrated propulsion--airframe design optimization.

This motivates a more detailed study of the boundary layer ingestion propulsor design, which requires considering the fully coupled airframe propulsion integration problem. However, boundary layer ingestion studies thus far have accounted only for the aerodynamic effects on the propulsion system, or vice versa, but have not considered the two-way coupling. This work presents a new approach for building fully coupled aeropropulsive models of boundary layer ingestion propulsion systems. A one-dimensional thermodynamic cycle analysis is coupled to a Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes simulation. This aeropropulsive model is used to assess how the propulsor design affects the overall performance for a
                  simplified model of the single-aisle turboelectric aircraft with an aft boundary-layer propulsor. The results indicate that both propulsion and aerodynamic effects contribute equally toward the overall performance and that the fully coupled model yields substantially different results compared to the uncoupled model. Although boundary layer ingestion offers substantial fuel burn savings, it introduces propulsion-dependent aerodynamic effects that need to be accounted for.

While various MDO software frameworks exist, none of them take full advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms to solve coupled models efficiently. Furthermore, there is a need to facilitate the computation of the derivatives of these coupled models for use with gradient-based optimization algorithms to enable design with respect to large numbers of variables. In this paper, we present the theory and architecture of OpenMDAO, an open-source MDO framework that uses Newton-type algorithms to solve coupled systems and exploits problem structure through new hierarchical strategies to achieve high computational efficiency. OpenMDAO also provides a framework for computing coupled derivatives efficiently and in a way that exploits problem sparsity. We demonstrate the framework's efficiency by benchmarking scalable test
                  problems. We also summarize a number of OpenMDAO applications previously reported in the literature, which include trajectory optimization, wing design, and structural topology optimization, demonstrating that the framework is effective in both coupling existing models and developing new multidisciplinary models from the ground up. Given the potential of the OpenMDAO framework, we expect the number of users and developers to continue growing, enabling even more diverse applications in engineering analysis and design.}

    abstract    = {Airframe--propulsion integration concepts that use boundary-layer ingestion (BLI) have the potential to reduce aircraft fuel burn. One concept that has been recently explored is NASA's STARC-ABL aircraft configuration, which offers the potential for fuel burn reduction by using a turboelectric propulsion system with an aft-mounted electrically driven BLI propulsor. So far, attempts to quantify this potential fuel burn reduction have not considered the full coupling between the aerodynamic and propulsive performance. To address the need for a more careful quantification of the aeropropulsive benefit of the STARC-ABL concept, we run a series of design optimisations based on a fully coupled aeropropulsive model. A 1D thermodynamic cycle analysis is coupled to a Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes simulation to model the aft propulsor at a cruise condition and the effects variation in propulsor design on overall performance. A series of design optimisation studies are
                  performed to minimise the required cruise power, assuming different relative sizes of the BLI propulsor. The design variables consist of the fan pressure ratio, static pressure at the fan face, and 311 variables that control the shape of both the nacelle and the fuselage. The power required by the BLI propulsor is compared with a podded configuration. The results show that the BLI configuration offers 6--9\% reduction in required power at cruise, depending on assumptions made about the efficiency of power transmission system between the under-wing engines and the aft propulsor. Additionally, the results indicate that the power transmission efficiency directly affects the relative size of the under-wing engines and the aft propulsor. This design optimisation, based on computational fluid dynamics, is shown to be essential to evaluate current BLI concepts and provides a powerful tool for the design of future concepts.}

We propose a new approach to study the effect of distortion on BLI propulsors via an aeropropulsive design optimization with a constraint on inlet distortion using highly efficient gradient-based methods with analytic derivatives. The fully coupled aeropropulsive model includes a three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes aerodynamic analysis of the flow and a thermodynamic cycle model of the propulsor fan. We minimize the shaft power required at cruise for the aft BLI thruster by varying the propulsor size and the shape of the propulsor nacelle and aft fuselage. Optimizations are performed with and without the inlet distortion constraint for different aft-propulsor sizes to study the impact of the constraint on overall BLI performance. The results show that imposing a distortion
                  constraint increased the required propulsor shaft power by up to 1.2\% relative to the unconstrained case, and that smaller propulsors suffer lower performance degradation than larger ones. The results underline the importance of using a fully coupled aeropropulsive model to predict BLI performance and demonstrate the power of aeropropulsive optimization in the design of BLI configurations.}

Different constraints are imposed to improve propeller design. Several advancements in the method are shown, including the option for quadratic skew, user specified skew distribution, and a constraint limiting the minimum pressure in wetted regions of the blade. Results for a series of fully wetted runs demonstrate the effectiveness of the constraint on minimum pressure in preventing the onset of bubble or mid-chord cavitation. A comparison of a design in uniform inflow with a design in non-axisymmetric inflow indicates that a propeller designed by the present method in non-axisymmetric inflow has more favorable cavitating flow characteristics than a propeller design assuming uniform inflow. Results are also shown for a series of runs utilizing the cavity constraints. These results indicate that the present method
                  can be used to improve on propeller designs by imposing constraints on the cavity area and cavity volume velocity harmonics, as well as by using a quadratic skew distribution.}}

Typical design variables are cross sectional dimensions for 1D and 2D elements with an additional complexity brought by composite materials with their directional and multi-layer aspects. Even if the scope of these design variables is clear and well understood, the vision of the structure behaviour is multi-criteria and encompasses various fidelity levels. Its design requires several stages from the future project to the detailed definition of structural parts using various analysis tools from different disciplines. These several stages require adequate structural optimisation processes to offer the best response with the right level of detail to answer questions being sought at each maturity level of the design. A review of methods and tools developed and applied at AIRBUS to deliver automated sizing for aircraft
                  structures along their development will be presented. Ways forward and major stakes for the future will be discussed. }

    abstract    = {AIRBUS are using a wide variety of tools for structural sizing. Indeed, depending on the design stage, the focus is put on different levels of definition. In late design stages the detailed design is addressed up to the arrangement of composite plies and advanced numerical tools are used for virtual testing. In preliminary design stages the distribution of thicknesses is considered with engineer justification stress tools. In early design stages the design is concentrated on architecture, choice of materials, choice of profiles and requires a fast sizing procedure and less accuracy on detailed stress calculations. Each design stage requires a suited methodology and tool. For the rapid sizing needed at conceptual design stage, a prototype tool called RHAPSODY has recently been developed by AIRBUS with SAMTECH for such sizing studies. The approach was to degrade in an acceptable extent the preliminary sizing in order to speed-up the reactivity of the tool and focus on
                  higher level parametric studies. Optimisation problem reductions and simplifications were made. Surrogate models from polynomial to Artificial Neural Networks were used. Library of profiles and materials were built and exploited. The optimisation process usually restricted to covers was extended to internal components with the target to address whole aircraft structure optimisation. This sizing tool, when fully mature and coupled with a full CAD-CAE associative link enabling architecture parameterisation should help AIRBUS to design the best airframe concepts in the quickest lead times.}

    abstract    = {Structural sizing optimization at Airbus leans on different approaches depending on the needs. Two main solutions have been defined, mainly for questions of performance and deployment. A rapid solution (PRESTO) has been developed based on a pure discrete algorithm to perform parametric trade-off studies in early design stages. The structure optimization process has been simplified in such a way that it is as quick as possible. This is the right solution to be used by non-expert users in early overall aircraft studies. It exploits large databases and surrogate models in a Big Data mindset. A more advanced solution (ACO-AMO) has been developed to support later design stages and more detailed optimization. It uses a standard continuous optimization approach based on gradient information and state of the art mathematical programming algorithms. A second step allows performing a discrete ply-by-ply optimization for composite covers using an optimization heuristic (ant
                  colony paradigm). This is the right technology to address advanced structure optimization and to be included in MDO processes. Both methods are under integration in a single platform (SOFIA) to provide adequate sizing optimization services for the relevant components (e.g. wing, fuselage) and design stages. A status will be made in this paper on the technologies used in the different tools, the applications performed and the current and future research and development axes especially in the effort to merge solutions or to integrate them in multidisciplinary processes.}

Because such applications require high resolution with reasonable turnaround, parallelization is essential. The pseudo-transient matrix-free Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (?NKS) algorithmic framework is presented as a widely applicable answer. This article shows that for the classical problem of three-dimensional transonic Euler flow about an M6 wing, ?NKS can simultaneously deliver globalized, asymptotically rapid convergence through adaptive pseudo-transient continuation and Newton?s method; reasonable parallelizability for an implicit method through deferred synchronization and favorable communication-to-computation scaling in the Krylov linear solver; and high per processor performance through attention to distributed memory and cache locality, especially through the Schwarz preconditioner. Two discouraging features of ?NKS methods are their sensitivity to
                  the coding of the underlying PDE discretization and the large number of parameters that must be selected to govern convergence. The authors therefore distill several recommendations from their experience and reading of the literature on various algorithmic components of ?NKS, and they describe a freely available MPI-based portable parallel software implementation of the solver employed here.}

A thorough review and classification of existing performance bookkeeping schemes suits as a basis for the derivation of a bookkeeping scheme suitable for the initial sizing as well as detailed design analysis during the conceptual phase of a BLI concept. Figures of merit for the concept performance assessment are evaluated with regard to the requirements of aircraft multidisciplinary conceptual design. Based on the survey, the most practical integral momentum conservation approach is deduced and its application to integrated conceptual sizing and a subsequent design analysis is evaluated. The proposed scheme is universally applicable to coupled airframe--propulsion aircraft concepts, compatible with standard aircraft and propulsion system sizing tools and,
                  under certain assumptions, deployable for low- and high-fidelity evaluation methods. Finally, several figures of merit are selected to cover a range of design aspects in the BLI evaluation.}

Because these materials permit the designer to tailor material properties to improve structural, aerodynamic and acoustic performance, they require a more integrated multidisciplinary design process. Because of the complexity of the design process numerical optimization methods are required. The present paper is focused on a major difficulty associated with the multidisciplinary design optimization process---its enormous computational cost. We consider two approaches for reducing this computational burden: (i)development of efficient methods for cross-sensitivity calculation using perturbation methods; and (ii) the use of approximate numerical optimization procedures. Our efforts are concentrated upon combined aerodynamic-structural optimization. Results are presented for the integrated design of a sailplane wing. The impact of our computational procedures on the
                  computational costs of integrated designs is discussed.}

The present paper suggests that there are computational benefits to treating this nested problem as a large single optimization problem. That is, the response variables (such as displacements) and the structural parameters are all treated as design variables in a unified formulation which performs simultaneously the design and analysis. Three truss examples are used for the demonstration comparing two nested optimization procedures with two computational procedures for the simultaneous solution. The examples show that the simultaneous approach is competitive with the more traditional nested approach.}

    abstract    = {Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) is a powerful tool for aircraft design. These design optimization methods often rely on the free-form deformation (FFD) method to parameterize geometry. However, the geometric parameterization with the FFD approach is not based on the original computer aided design (CAD)-based geometry definition. As a result, the optimized designs obtained from the FFD approach are not compatible with standard design and manufacturing workflows. CAD in the loop of a high-fidelity MDO framework can then bridge this gap between MDO methods and design or manufacturing needs. To effectively integrate CAD into optimization, the surface mesh points' relationship to the CAD geometry needs to be tracked in order to calculate derivatives for gradient-based optimization and morph the mesh as the geometry changes. In this work, we present ongoing efforts on coupling MDO to CAD as well as a comparison of results obtained from traditional FFD methods.
                  Results for aerodynamic shape optimization are discussed. We show that FFD-based optimizations and CAD-based optimizations for airfoil cases and a wing case starting from the same baseline designs can achieve the same optimized design, validating both the surface mesh tracking algorithm and the derivatives for the CAD method. The presented method is a critical prerequisite for integrating CAD-based geometric parameterizations in simulation based MDO frameworks.}

Using a detailed representation of an aircraft's systems and payload geometries in a packaging constraint allows for more accurate and higher-performance spatial integration. We use a previously developed general and differentible packaging constraint formulated for gradient-based optimization for aerodynamic shape optimization of a full aircraft configuration. We explore the design of the NASA tiltwing concept vehicle with aerodynamic shape optimization using packaging constraints to examine the tradeoffs between aerodynamics and mission performance. The resulting design can be more targeted to our design requirements than one that can be achieved with conventional geometric constraints.}

    abstract    = {The accurate prediction of transition is relevant for aerodynamic analysis and design applications. Extending the laminar flow region over airframes is a potential way to reduce the skin friction drag, which in turn reduces fuel burn and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper introduces a numerical framework that includes the modeling of transition effects for high Reynolds number flows in a high-fidelity, Reynolds--averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) aerodynamic design framework. The CFD solver uses a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element approach and includes goal-oriented adaptation. The Spalart--Allmaras (SA) turbulence model is used for the closure of the governing equations. In the flow stability analysis, the nonlocal, nonparallel effects that characterize boundary layers are accounted for by using the parabolized stability equations (PSE). Transition onset is obtained through an method based on the PSE computations, while a smooth intermittency function
                  includes the transition region length. Numerical results for the NLF(1)-0416 airfoil present good agreement with experimental data, improving the computations when compared to fully-turbulent ones.}

Modified Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models that consider transition to turbulence have gained traction in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) community. These models enable the computation of transitional flows without the need for external modules. In this work, we use a smooth version of the amplification factor transport (AFT) model, called AFT-S, to perform gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO) of airfoils in subsonic and transonic flow conditions. We investigate the benefits of including transition effects into the optimization process and assess the impact of losing laminar flow when early transition to turbulence occurs due to surface contamination. Our results indicate that our design optimization approach yields lower drag airfoils when transition effects are
                  considered. For the transonic case, the optimizer trades between shock wave strength and laminar flow extension to minimize drag.}

It also increases the level of physical representations for simulations of standard airframes because laminar flow regions may be present in parts of the aircraft in multiple flight conditions. Modified Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models that consider transition effects became popular in the last decade and indicated favorable agreement with experimental data. However, these models present more difficult convergence behavior when compared with fully turbulent RANS approaches. To address this issue, an approximate Newton--Krylov solver is leveraged to solve the transitional flow over aeronautical configurations using a flow-stability-based, smooth RANS transition model. The amplification factor transport (AFT) model is modified to create a smooth variant, referred to as AFT-S. Strategies have been developed to
                  obtain representative physical solutions that exhibit good agreement with experimental data. The convergence behavior for the transition RANS model is also addressed, and its impact on the numerical results is assessed. These results constitute the first in-depth investigation on the numerical behavior of an AFT-type transition model.}

    abstract    = {This paper presents a description of the physical principles of aerodynamic power savings from boundary layer ingestion propulsion and a quantitative evaluation of the boundary layer ingestion benefit for advanced civil aircraft. Control volume and one-dimensional analyses are used to illustrate two major features of boundary layer ingestion: reduction of jet mixing losses due to decreased jet kinetic energy from reduced velocity of flow entering the propulsor and, to a lesser extent, reduction of airframe wake mixing losses. Embedded boundary layer ingestion propulsion systems can also enable nacelles with reduced surface area and associated weight and drag, further decreasing the aircraft propulsive power requirement. The required propulsor flow power is shown to decrease with increases in both the amount of boundary layer ingested and the propulsor mass flow, and there is thus no unique way to compare boundary layer ingestion and non-boundary-layer-ingestion
                  systems. Using the ideas presented, however, the benefit can be assessed for any given comparison. The analysis is applied to an advanced civil transport aircraft concept with 40\% of the fuselage boundary layer ingested, yielding a reduction in required propulsor mechanical power of 9\% relative to a non-boundary-layer-ingestion configuration with the same propulsors, in agreement with computational fluid dynamics calculations and wind tunnel experiments.}

A two-phase algorithm is proposed for Problem P{\textasciiacutex}. In phase I, this algorithm obtains rapidly a solution which is often globally$\epsilon$-optimal. Moreover, a sufficient condition onf for this to be the case is given. In phase II, the algorithm proves the$\epsilon$-optimality of the solution obtained in phase I or finds a sequence of points of increasing value containing one with a globally$\epsilon$-optimal value. The new algorithm is empirically compared (on twenty problems from the literature) with a best possible algorithm (for which
                  the optimal value is assumed to be known), with a passive algorithm and with the algorithms of Evtushenko, Galperin, Shen and Zhu, Piyavskii, Timonov and Schoen. For small$\epsilon$, the new algorithm requires only a few percent more function evaluations than the best possible one. An extended version of Piyavskii's algorithm is proposed for problem Q{\textacutedbl}. A sufficient condition onf is given for the globally optimal points to be in one-to-one correspondance with the obtained intervals. This result is achieved for all twenty test problems.}

The problems of finding an optimal solution, an $\epsilon$-optimal one, all optimal solutions, and a small volume enclosure of all optimal solutions within hyperrectangles (possibly containing only a-optimal points) are investigated. In the univariate case, necessary conditions for finite convergence are studied as well as bounds on the number of iterations and convergence of e-optimal algorithms. Methods of Piyayskii, Evtushenko, Timonov, Schoen, Galperin, Shen and Zhu, and Hansen, Jaumard and Lu are discussed and compared experimentally. The same is done in the multivariate case for the algorithms of Piyayskii; Mladineo; Jaumard, Herrmann and Ribault; Pinter; Galperin; Meewella and Mayne; Wood; Gourdin, Hansen and Jaumard.}

The model incorporates several expense-estimating equations that capture direct and indirect expenses of both passenger and cargo airlines. The variables and business factors included in the equations allow expenses to be calculated at the flight equipment (i.e., aircraft) reporting level. Total operating expenses for a given airline are then obtained by summation of all aircraft an entity operates followed by summation for all entities operated by the airline.
                  
                  The model's accuracy is demonstrated by correlation with the DOT Form 41 data from which it was derived. The specific Form 41 accounts, for which expense equations were derived and correlation shown, are as follows: For Total Aircraft Operating Expenses (direct expenses) Flight Crew Fuel & Oil Insurance Rental Other Flying Operations Airframe Maintenance Engine Maintenance Depreciation & Amortization For All Other Operating Expenses (indirect expenses) Passenger Service Landing Fees Rest of All Other (Includes: Aircraft Servicing, Traffic Servicing, Advertising & Promotions, General & Administration, Maintenance & Depreciation of Ground Equipment) Transport Related}

    abstract    = {Advances in computing power have enabled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to become a crucial tool in aerodynamic design. To facilitate CFD-based design, the combination of gradient-based optimization and the adjoint method for computing derivatives can be used to optimize designs with respect to a large number of design variables. Open field operation and manipulation (OpenFOAM) is an open source CFD package that is becoming increasingly popular, but it currently lacks an efficient infrastructure for constrained design optimization. To address this problem, we develop an optimization framework that consists of an efficient discrete adjoint implementation for computing derivatives and a Python interface to multiple numerical optimization packages. Our adjoint optimization framework has the following salient features: (1) The adjoint computation is efficient, with a computational cost that is similar to that of the primal flow solver and scales up to 10 million
                  cells and 1024 CPU cores. (2) The adjoint derivatives are fully consistent with those generated by the flow solver with an average error of less than 0.1\%. (3) The adjoint framework can handle optimization problems with more than 100 design variables and various geometric and physical constraints such as volume, thickness, curvature, and lift constraints. (4) The framework includes additional modules that are essential for successful design optimization: a geometry-parametrization module, a mesh-deformation algorithm, and an interface to numerical optimizations. To demonstrate our design-optimization framework, we optimize the ramp shape of a simple bluff geometry and analyze the flow in detail. We achieve 9.4\% drag reduction, which is validated by wind tunnel experiments. Furthermore, we apply the framework to solve two more complex aerodynamic-shape-optimization applications: an unmanned aerial vehicle, and a car. For these two cases, the drag is reduced by 5.6\%
                  and 12.1\%, respectively, which demonstrates that the proposed optimization framework functions as desired. Given these validated improvements, the developed techniques have the potential to be a useful tool in a wide range of engineering design applications, such as aircraft, cars, ships, and turbomachinery.}

    abstract    = {Aerodynamic design optimization currently lacks robustness with respect to the starting design and requires trial and error in the flow solver and optimization algorithm settings to get a converged optimal design. We address need issue by developing ways to overcome robustness issues arising from shape parametrization, mesh deformation, and flow solver convergence. Our approach is demonstrated on the Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group (ADODG) airfoil optimization benchmarks to show the factors that dominate the robustness and efficiency. In the ADODG NACA 0012 benchmark, we address the additional issue of non-unique solutions. In the ADODG RAE 2822 case, we address solver failure due to shock waves, separation, and gradient accuracies due to the frozen turbulence model. Finally, we create a new, challenging aerodynamic shape optimization case that starts with a circle to test the robustness of our aerodynamic shape optimization framework. We use both
                  fixed and adaptive parametrization methods to tackle this problem and show how we can exploit the advantages of adaptive parametrization methods to improve both robustness and efficiency. The combination of flow solver robustness, precision of gradient information, robust mesh deformation, and adaptive parametrization brings us closer to a ``push-button'' solution for airfoil design.}

    abstract    = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based optimization is becoming increasingly popular in hydrodynamic design of ship hulls because it provides a fully automatic framework with a shorter design cycle than a human-supervised design tool. Despite the above advantage, CFD-based optimization requires careful attention to relevant design considerations, such that the final design is useful in practice. These considerations include all relevant objectives (such as drag and wake distortion) and constraints (such as volume, thickness, and curvature). Although constraints have been included in previous hull shape optimization studies, these studies have typically considered only one objective. To address this shortcoming, we conduct design optimization for self-propulsion by simultaneously considering drag and propeller-wake distortion. We use a gradient-based optimization framework that includes a discrete adjoint method for efficient derivative computation, which allows us
                  to use a large number of design variables to parameterize the complex hull shape and thus gain a large amount of freedom for geometric modification. We impose appropriate geometric constraints (volume, thickness, and curvature) on the hull surface to ensure a practical design. In addition, we use a weighted objective function that includes drag and wake distortion to construct a Pareto front with five optimizations. We also consider hull-propeller interaction by comparing optimization results with and without a propeller. We use the Japan bulk carrier (JBC) as the baseline model and focus on optimizing the stern region. We find that optimizing for only one objective results in a large penalty on the other objective, whereas a weighted objective balances the penalty and achieves simultaneous improvement in drag and wake distortion. Moreover, we observe that the suction effect of the propeller suppresses the flow separation near the bilge tube and smooths out the
                  velocity distortion at the propeller plane; these are effects that would end up affecting the optimized shapes. Our results demonstrate that it is necessary to simultaneously consider drag and wake distortion in hull-shape-optimization studies, and that constrained shape optimization with a large number of design variables is possible with the discrete-adjoint method.}

    abstract    = {Aerothermal optimization is a powerful technique for automating the design of turbine internal cooling passages, where both pressure loss and heat transfer are considered. Existing optimization studies commonly adopt gradient-free algorithms, which can handle only a few design variables. However, to enhance heat transfer, internal cooling designs use complex geometries consisting of ribbed serpentine channels, which need to be parameterized by using a large number of design variables. To address this need, we develop herein an approach for aerothermal optimization that uses a gradient-based optimizer in conjunction with a discrete adjoint method to efficiently compute the required gradients with respect to numerous design variables. We apply this approach to the design of a ribbed U-bend channel, which is representative of a section of turbine internal cooling passages. The objective function combines heat transfer and pressure loss as a weighted sum. We find the
                  Pareto front for these two objectives by running five optimizations with different weights. We consider both a rib-free and a ribbed U-bend configuration. For the rib-free configuration, we use 113 design variables to parameterize the U-bend shape. We compare our optimization results with those from gradient-free methods and demonstrate that the proposed method leads to lower pressure loss while enhancing heat transfer. For the ribbed configuration, we use 146 design variables and allow the ribs to change their arrangement independently (shape, height, pitch, and angle). Each rib adopts a requisite arrangement to balance heat transfer and aerodynamics, depending on the local flow conditions. Optimizing the U-bend shape is shown to be more effective for improving overall heat transfer than optimizing the rib arrangement. However, optimizing ribs is more effective for improving local heat transfer. The results demonstrate that the proposed optimization framework has the
                  potential to handle general turbine heat transfer designs, not only for internal cooling but also for other design problems, such as film cooling and jet impingement cooling.}

Despite this advantage, implementing the adjoint method for a partial-differential-equation-based primal solver is a time-consuming task. To lower the barrier for adjoint implementations, an object-oriented framework (DAFoam) is proposed to rapidly implement the discrete adjoint method for any steady-state OpenFOAM primal solver by adding or modifying only a few hundred lines of source code. In this paper, the DAFoam framework is introduced and the proposed object-oriented adjoint development processis illustrated.Usingthisstrategy,the adjointmethodis implementedfor eightprimal solvers,five turbulence models, and one radiation model in OpenFOAM. Excellent adjoint speed and scalability, with up to 10 million cells and 1536 CPU cores, and an average error in the adjoint derivatives of less
                  than 0.1\% are achieved. Finally, the implemented adjoint solvers and models are integrated into a gradient-based optimization framework, and four distinct design optimizations (multipoint aerodynamic optimization of a low-speed unmanned-aerial-vehicle wing, aerodynamic optimization of a transonic aircraft configuration, aerothermal optimization of a turbine internal cooling passage, and aerostructural optimization of a compressor rotor) are shown. DAFoam is available under an open-source license and is a powerful tool for the high-fidelity multidisciplinary design optimization of engineering systems, such as aircraft, ground vehicles, marine vessels, and turbomachinery.}

    abstract    = {Discrete variable topology optimization problems are usually solved by using solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP), genetic algorithms (GA), or mixed-integer nonlinear optimization (MINLO). In this paper, we propose formulating discrete ply-angle and thickness topology optimization problems as a mixed-integer second-order cone optimization (MISOCO) problem. Unlike SIMP and GA methods, MISOCO efficiently finds the problem's globally optimal solution. Furthermore, in contrast with existing MISOCO formulations of discrete ply-angle optimization problems, our reformulations allow the structure to change topology, consider the more realistic Tsai--Wu stress yield criteria constraint, and eliminate checkerboard patterns using simple linear constraints. We address two types of discrete ply-angle and thickness problems: a structural mass minimization problem and a compliance optimization problem where the objective is to maximize the structural stiffness. For
                  each element, one first chooses if the element is present or not in the structure. One can then choose the element's ply-angle and thickness from a finite set of possibilities for the former case. The discrete design space for ply-angle and thickness is a result of manufacturing limitations. To improve the problem's MISOCO solution approach, we develop valid inequality constraints to tighten the continuous relaxation of the MISOCO reformulation. We compare the performance of various MISOCO solvers: Gurobi, CPLEX, and MOSEK to solve the MISOCO reformulation. We also use BARON to solve the original MINLO formulations of the problems. Our results show that solving the MISOCO problem's formulation using MOSEK is the most efficient solution approach.}

Previous harmonic-balance-based flutter and LCO prediction methods either have low linear convergence rates or require expensive Newton steps to achieve quadratic convergence. In this paper, we propose a preconditioned, Jacobian-free, coupled Newton--Krylov (CNK) method for the time-spectral aeroelastic equations. By solving the coupled system directly, the method reduces the computational cost of each Newton step, making quadratic convergence affordable. The proposed Jacobian-free method is easier to implement and requires less memory relative to previous methods. We demonstrate the capability of the CNK solver by verifying the results against a time-accurate solver and by comparing them to other harmonic-balance-based results reported in the literature. We observe that the proposed method is more efficient than the time-accurate method in LCO response
                  simulations. And the LCO velocities and frequencies predicted by the proposed method and the time-accurate method are within 1\% of relative difference when the same mesh is used. This method can be potentially used in aircraft design.}

    abstract    = {Aerodynamic shape optimization has become a well-established process, with designers routinely performing wing and full aircraft optimizations with hundreds of geometric design variables. However, with increased geometric design freedom comes increased optimization difficulty. These optimizations tend to converge very slowly, often taking many hundreds of design iterations. In addition, designers have to manually obtain suitable design variable scaling through trial and error in order to have a well-behaved optimization problem, which is a tedious and time-consuming task. In this work, we propose a sensitivity-based geometric parameterization approach that, while keeping the same optimization problem, maps the design space onto one which is better suited for gradient-based optimization. At the same time, we can automatically determine appropriate design variable scaling such that the new optimization problem can be solved more rapidly. We demonstrate the approach on
                  aerodynamic optimizations, and show improved convergence behaviour compared to the traditional approach.}

    abstract    = {Dynamical systems often exhibit limit cycle oscillations (LCOs), self-sustaining oscillations of limited amplitude. LCOs can be supercritical or subcritical. The supercritical response is benign, while the subcritical response can be bi-stable and exhibit a hysteretic response. Subcritical responses can be avoided in design optimization by enforcing LCO stability. However, many high-fidelity system models are computationally expensive to evaluate. Thus, there is a need for an efficient computational approach that can model instability and handle hundreds or thousands of design variables. To address this need, we propose a simple metric to determine the LCO stability using a fitted bifurcation diagram slope. We develop an adjoint-based formula to efficiently compute the stability derivative with respect to many design variables. To evaluate the stability derivative, we only need to compute the time-spectral adjoint equation three times, regardless of the number of
                  design variables. The proposed adjoint method is verified with finite differences, achieving a five-digit agreement between the two approaches. We consider a stability-constrained LCO parameter optimization problem using an analytic model to demonstrate that the optimizer can suppress the instability. We also consider a more realistic LCO speed and stability-constrained airfoil problem that minimizes the normalized mass and stiffness. The proposed method could be extended to optimization problems with a partial differential equation (PDE) based model, opening the door to other applications where high-fidelity models are needed.}

    abstract    = {A linearized aero-hydro-servo-elastic floating wind turbine model is presented and used to perform integrated design optimization of the platform, tower, mooring system, and blade-pitch controller for a 10 MW spar floating wind turbine. Optimal design solutions are found using gradient-based optimization with analytic derivatives, considering both fatigue and extreme response constraints, where the objective function is a weighted combination of system cost and power quality. Optimization results show that local minima exist both in the soft-stiff and stiff-stiff range for the first tower bending mode and that a stiff-stiff tower design is needed to reach a solution that satisfies the fatigue constraints. The optimized platform has a relatively small diameter in the wave zone to limit the wave loads on the structure and an hourglass shape far below the waterline. The shape increases the restoring moment and natural frequency in pitch, which leads to improved
                  behaviour in the low-frequency range. The importance of integrated optimization is shown in the solutions for the tower and blade-pitch control system, which are clearly affected by the simultaneous design of the platform. State-of-the-art nonlinear time-domain analyses show that the linearized model is conservative in general, but reasonably accurate in capturing trends, suggesting that the presented methodology is suitable for preliminary integrated design calculations.}

    abstract    = {One of the challenges related to the design of floating wind turbines (FWTs) is the strong interactions between the controller and the support structure, which may result in an unstable system. Several control strategies have been proposed to improve the dynamic behaviour, all of which result in trade-offs between structural loads, rotor speed variation, and blade pitch actuator use, which makes controller design a challenging task. Due to the interactions, simultaneous design of the controller and support structure should be performed to properly identify and compare different solutions. In the present work, integrated design optimization of the blade-pitch controller and support structure is performed for a 10 MW spar FWT, considering four different control strategies, to evaluate the effect of the controller on the structural design and associated costs. The introduction of velocity feedback control reduces the platform pitch response and consequently the fatigue
                  loads in the tower, which leads to a decrease in the tower costs compared to a simple PI controller. Low-pass filtering of the nacelle velocity signal to remove the wave-frequency components results in reduced rotor speed variation, but offers only small improvements in costs, likely due to the limited wave-frequency response for the considered designs. Comparisons with nonlinear time-domain simulations show that the linearized model is able to capture trends with acceptable accuracy, but that significant overpredictions may occur for the platform pitch response.}

    abstract    = {Abstract This paper presents a newly developed high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction simulation tool for geometrically resolved rotor simulations of wind turbines. The tool consists of a partitioned coupling between the structural part of the aero-elastic solver HAWC2 and the finite volume computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver EllipSys3D. The paper shows that the implemented loose coupling scheme, despite a non-conservative force transfer, maintains a sufficient numerical stability and a second-order time accuracy. The use of a strong coupling is found to be redundant. In a first test case, the newly developed coupling between HAWC2 and EllipSys3D (HAWC2CFD) is utilized to compute the aero-elastic response of the NREL 5-MW reference wind turbine (RWT) under normal operational conditions. A comparison with the low-fidelity but state-of-the-art aero-elastic solver HAWC2 reveals a very good agreement between the two approaches. In a second test case, the
                  response of the NREL 5-MW RWT is computed during a yawed and thus asymmetric inflow. The continuous good agreement confirms the qualities of HAWC2CFD but also illustrates the strengths of a computationally cheaper blade element momentum theory (BEM) based solver, as long as the solver is applied within the boundaries of the employed engineering models. Two further test cases encompass flow situations, which are expected to exceed the limits of the BEM model. However, the simulation of the NREL 5-MW RWT during an emergency shut down situation still shows good agreements in the predicted structural responses of HAWC2 and HAWC2CFD since the differences in the computed force signals only persist for an insignificantly short time span. The considerable new capabilities of HAWC2CFD are finally demonstrated by simulating vortex-induced vibrations on the DTU 10-MW wind turbine blade in standstill.}

The continued growth of air traffic has caused increasing demands to reduce aircraft emissions, imposing new constraints on the design and development of future airplane concepts. In this paper, an aircraft design optimisation framework is used to design aircraft that minimise specific envi- ronmental metrics. Multidisciplinary design optimisation is used to optimise aircraft by simultaneously considering airframe, engine and mission. The environmental metrics considered in this investigation are CO2 emissions --- which are proportional to fuel burn --- and landing- takeoff NOx emissions. The results are compared to those of an aircraft with minimum direct operating cost. The design variables considered in the optimisation problems include aircraft geom- etry, engine parameters, and cruise settings. An augmented Lagrangian particle swarm optimiser and a genetic algorithm
                  are used to solve the single objective and multi-objective optimisation problems, respectively.}

These future aircraft concepts include the STARC-ABL, D8 and N-3X among other examples. While BLI technology appears to be promising for improving the aircraft performance by reducing fuel burn, the benefits and challenges of using this technology are not well understood. As a result, there are a number of e orts ongoing within NASA which are attempting to model BLI and determine its overall bene t. Despite their common goal, there seems to be significant differences in the modeling approaches used in each e ort, with limited communication and collaboration between these groups. The purpose of this report is to document NASA's in-house BLI modeling e orts and their associated methodologies. Furthermore, the report will identify strengths and weaknesses of each methodology, specifically in regards to each

The problem is investigated for the well known ten-bar truss structure. Results show that decreasing the number of cross-sections from nine to four has a small impact on the weight of the structure of approximately 5.4\%. Furthermore, as the number of cross-sections increases, so does the number of critical constraints. This indicates higher probability of failure.}

Trilinos addresses two fundamental issues of developing software for these problems: (i) Providing a streamlined process and set of tools for development of new algorithmic implementations and (ii) promoting interoperability of independently developed software. \par Trilinos uses a two-level software structure designed around collections of packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed by a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist underneath the Trilinos top level, which provides a common look-and-feel, including configuration, documentation, licensing, and bug-tracking. \par Here we present the
                  overall Trilinos design, describing our use of abstract interfaces and default concrete implementations. We discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package and how these services are used by various packages. We also illustrate how packages can be combined to rapidly develop new algorithms. Finally, we discuss how Trilinos facilitates highquality software engineering practices that are increasingly required from simulation software.}

    abstract    = {In a composite material, stiffness and strength in a desired direction can be controlled via the combination and stacking of materials. As such, the application of composite materials has spread to almost every industry. To utilize this advantage in the design of a marine propeller with complex geometry, accurate and practical analysis tools that consider both the hydroelastic behavior and ply-stacking structure of composite materials are required. Therefore, steady and unsteady BEM--FEM FSI algorithms of a composite propeller blade and a simple finite element model that considers the lamination modulus of fiber materials have been introduced in this study. In addition, a comparative study using CFD--FEM-based FSI analysis and numerical investigation of the hydroelastic behavior of a composite propeller in the ship wake field have been performed based on the present methodology.}

    abstract    = {The equations of motion are developed by two complementary methods, Hamilton's principle and the Newtonian method. The former is more mathematically rigorous and systematic, while the latter provides more physical insight. The resulting equations are valid to second order for long, straight, slender, homogeneous, isotropic beams undergoing moderate displacements. The ordering scheme is based on the restriction that squares of the bending slopes, the torsion deformation, and the chord/radius and thickness/radius ratios are negligible with respect to unity. All remaining nonlinear terms are retained. The equations are valid for beams with mass centroid axis and area centroid (tension) axis offsets from the elastic axis, nonuniform mass and stiffness section properties, variable pretwist, and a small precone angle. The straindisplacement relations are developed from an exact transformation between the deformed and undeformed coordinate systems. These nonlinear relations
                  form an important contribution to the final equations. Several nonlinear structural and inertial terms in the final equations are identified that can substantially influence the aeroelastic stability and response of hingeless helicopter rotor blades.}

First, presents a classification of problems, and then focuses on a basic definition of combined fleet composition and routing: the fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem. A basic mathematical formulation from the literature is presented. Further, the literature of extended and related problems is described and categorized. Surveys of application oriented research in road-based and maritime transportation conclude the review. Finally, we contrast the literature with aspects of industrial applications from a critical, but constructive stance. Major issues for future work are suggested.}

    abstract    = {Because commercial aircraft are built with thin-walled structures, their structural performance is well-modeled using shell-element meshes. However, creating these meshes for the full aircraft configuration can be challenging and presents a bottleneck in the design process, especially in a configuration-level design space. This paper presents an algorithm that automatically creates unstructured quadrilateral meshes for the full airframe based on just the description of the desired structural members. The approach consists in representing each node in the mesh as a linear combination of points on the geometry so that the structural mesh morphs as the geometry changes, as it would, for example, in aerostructural optimization. The algorithm divides the aircraft skin into 4-sided domains based on the underlying B-spline representation of the geometry. It meshes each domain independently using an algorithm based on constrained Delaunay triangulation, triangle merging and
                  splitting to obtain a quadrilateral mesh, and elliptical smoothing. Examples of full-configuration structural meshes are provided, and a mesh convergence study is performed to show that element quality is maintained as the structural mesh is refined. The algorithm is available as part of the open-source aircraft geometry tool suite, GeoMACH.

    abstract    = {One of the challenges in computational modeling is coupling models to solve multidisciplinary problems. Flow-based computational frameworks alleviate part of the challenge through a modular approach, where data flows from component to component. However, existing flow-based frameworks are inefficient when coupled derivatives are needed for optimization. To address this, we develop the modular analysis and unified derivatives (MAUD) architecture. MAUD formulates the multidisciplinary model as a nonlinear system of equations, which leads to a linear equation that unifies all methods for computing derivatives. This enables flow-based frameworks that use the MAUD architecture to provide a common interface for the chain rule, adjoint method, coupled adjoint method, and hybrid methods; MAUD automatically uses the appropriate method for the problem. A hierarchical, matrix-free approach enables modern solution techniques such as Newton--Krylov solvers to be used within this
                  monolithic formulation without computational overhead. Two demonstration problems are solved using a Python implementation of MAUD: a nanosatellite optimization with more than 2 million unknowns and 25,000 design variables, and an aircraft optimization involving over 6,000 design variables and 23,000 constraints. MAUD is now implemented in the open source framework OpenMDAO, which has been used to solve aircraft, satellite, wind turbine, and turbofan engine design problems.}

    abstract    = {Surrogate models approximate a function based on a set of training points and can then predict the function at new points. In engineering, kriging is widely used because it is fast to train and is generally more accurate than other types of surrogate models. However, the prediction time of kriging increases with the size of the dataset, and the training can fail if the dataset is too large or poorly spaced, which limits the accuracy that is attainable. We develop a new surrogate modeling technique---regularized minimal-energy tensor-product splines (RMTS)---that is not susceptible to training failure, and whose prediction time does not increase with the number of training points. The improved scalability with the number of training points is due to the use of tensor-product splines, where energy minimization is used to handle under-constrained problems in which there are more spline coefficients than training points. RMTS scales up to four dimensions with 10--15
                  spline coefficients per dimension, but scaling beyond that requires coarsening of the spline in some of the dimensions because of the computational cost of the energy minimization step. Benchmarking using a suite of one- to four-dimensional problems shows that while kriging is the most accurate option for a small number of training points, RMTS is the best alternative when a large set of data points is available or a low prediction time is desired. The best-case average root-mean-square error for the 4-D problems is close to 1\% for RMTS and just under 10\% for kriging.}

    abstract    = {Traditionally, computational design optimization of commercial aircraft is performed by considering a small number of representative operating conditions. These conditions are based on the design Mach number, altitude, payload, and range for which the aircraft will be flown. However, the design also influences which routes and mission parameters are optimal, and so there is coupling that is ignored when using the traditional approach. Here, the aircraft design, mission profiles, and the allocation of aircraft to routes in an airline network are simultaneously optimized. This is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem that is reformulated as a nonlinear programming problem because of the large number of design variables. The reformulated problem is solved using a gradient-based optimization approach with a parallel computational framework that facilitates the multidisciplinary analysis and the derivative computation. A surrogate model is used for the
                  computational fluid dynamics analysis that is retrained in each optimization iteration given the new set of shape design variables. The resulting optimization problem contains over 4,000 design variables and close to 14,000 constraints. The optimization results show a 2\% increase in airline profit compared with the traditional multipoint optimization approach. The wing area increases to the upper bound, enabling a higher cruise altitude that improves propulsive efficiency. This study finds that simultaneously optimizing the allocation, mission, and design to maximize airline profit results in a different optimized wing design from that resulting from the multipoint optimization approach.}

As these tools have been developed over time, there is often little consideration for shared software infrastructure between the tools, which makes design and analysis cumbersome due to a lack of commonality in input and output data and reporting, as well as poor traceability of results. Under the Rapid Tools task of the Advanced Composites Consortium (ACC), four aerospace tools were recently implemented or enhanced in the HyperSizer{\textregistered} stress framework and then evaluated by this consortium of industry and government organizations. The framework provides an automated software environment for executing the rapid tools for analysis and sizing, quantifying margins of safety for thousands of load cases, and generating reports in support of FAA certification. This paper describes the process by which the tools were enhanced
                  or implemented in the stress framework under the ACC project, and the evaluation conducted by industry consortium members. }

    abstract    = {Abstract Wind turbine design is a challenging multidisciplinary optimization problem, where the aerodynamic shapes, structural member sizing, and material composition must all be determined and optimized. Some previous blade design methods incorporate static loading with an added safety factor to account for dynamic effects. Others incorporate dynamic loading, but in general limit, the evaluation to a few design cases. By not fully incorporating the dynamic loading of the wind turbine, the final turbine blade design is either too conservative by overemphasizing the dynamic effects or infeasible by failing to adequately account for these effects. We propose an iterative method that estimates fatigue effects during the optimization process while quickly converging to the true solution. We also demonstrate an alternate approach where a surrogate model is trained to efficiently estimate the dynamic loading of the wind turbine in the design process. This surrogate model,
                  once trained, was then incorporated in the optimization loop of the wind turbine blade. In contrast to the iterative method, there is significant upfront computational cost to construct the surrogate model. However, this surrogate model has been generalized to be used for different rated turbines and can predict the fatigue damage of a wind turbine with less than 5\% error for baseline wind turbines of the same family. These methods can be used instead of the more computationally expensive method of calculating the dynamic loading of the turbine within the optimization routine.}

    abstract    = {Preliminary sizing of aircraft structures is an inherently complex and costly exercise. In an industrial environ- ment, this typically implies the early identification of structural dimensions with a good final-design represent- ativeness, leading to a specific class of structural-optimisation problems with very many constraints and design parameters. Further to the inherent complexities of the optimisation-problem formulation and solution, specific conditions for robustness and interoperability with the industrial design processes have to be also considered. This paper aims to introduce recent developments at Airbus for large-scale numerical optimisation of both metal- lic and composite structures, in the form of the Advanced Composite/Metallic Optimisation frameworks. First, the approaches chosen to address the structural-optimisation problem are described. Second, industry-specific siz- ing criteria and associated solutions are reviewed, including the specific
                  requirements for constraints arising from stress criteria for static-stress and fatigue-and-damage-tolerance analyses, as well as from design criteria (like manufacturing ramp rates). Finally, prospects for further academic and applied research are discussed, covering multi-fidelity/multi-scale aspects as well as model parameterisation and loadspace characterisation techniques.}

As a result, high-fidelity analysis tools are required that can efficiently identify flutter within the flight envelope, and find design modifications to alleviate adverse aeroelastic behavior. To address these requirements, we have systematically evaluated automated methods to identify the damping of an aeroelastic system from a time-domain simulation. The techniques evaluated include the log decrement method, envelope function methods that use the Hilbert transformation, the half-power bandwidth method, and the matrix pencil method. The optimal approach was determined to be the matrix pencil method due to its robustness to noise and its ability to handle multi-component signals over short time simulations. Identification of the flutter boundary of the AGARD-445.6 wing is
                  demonstrated with an automated method based on the adjoint sensitivities and the matrix pencil method. While the matrix pencil method is robust, identification of the flutter boundary using gradient-based optimization is shown to be sensitive to the initial dynamic pressure guess.}

    abstract    = {Due to the high computational cost associated with unsteady aeroelastic analysis, state-of-the-art aeroelastic optimizations based on computational fluid dynamics typically ignore critical constraints like flutter and aeroelastic gust response. The linearized frequency-domain method offers an approach for adding high-fidelity flutter constraints to multidisciplinary optimizations at relatively low cost compared to other unsteady computational fluid dynamics methods. In recent work, sensitivities have been implemented for the linearized frequency-domain method in FUN3D. In this work, the linearized frequency-domain method and associated sensitivities are applied to gradient-based aeroelastic optimization with flutter constraints based on computational fluid dynamics. An overview of the flutter constraint formulation and implementation is provided, and then two optimization problems are presented. The first optimization increases the flutter speed of a pitch and plunge
                  airfoil at transonic conditions using the minimal amount of geometric changes. The second optimization minimizes the mass of the AGARD 445.6 wing subject to a flutter constraint.}

    abstract    = {The objective of this study is to investigate the collapsing behavior of cavitation, which leads to the erosion of material. An experimental examination was conducted in a channel with a semi-circular cylinder obstacle, which serves as a ``vortex cavity'' generator. Cavitation was achieved by employing a range of pressure differences over the test section and a high-speed camera was used to observe the cavitation behavior. The flow field behind the semi-circular cylinder was investigated as a characteristic example of bluff bodies that exhibit a distinct, separated vortex flow in their wake. The cases with the bluff body were also compared to the ones without the bluff body. Erosion tests were performed using paint (stencil ink). The intensity of cavitation is characterized by the cavitation number (σ); the lower the cavitation number, the higher the cavitation intensity. The erosion (removal of paint) after 40 min of operation revealed distinct and repeatable
                  results. For a high cavitation number, a large number of von Karman-vortex-like cavities are shed downstream of the obstacle. This results in a higher number of collapse events and, ultimately, more erosion. On the other hand, at lower cavitation numbers, the erosion took place at the cavity's closure line. It was seen that with the increase in cavitation intensity, the erosion area increases. Moreover, the bluff body obstacle promotes and localizes cavitation-induced erosion on the sample plate compared to the cases without the bluff body. This ultimately means that in the cases with the bluff body, less power is required in the system to cause erosion. The erosion patterns caused by the bluff body cavitation are more repeatable compared to the cases without the bluff body due to the localized cavitation load. The erosion pattern from the paint test is also compared with a material loss test (30 h of operation). A very good qualitative agreement is found between
                  the two tests, with the paint test requiring approximately two orders of magnitude less running time of the facility. We demonstrate that paint tests, combined with this geometry, provide an efficient and economical way to investigate erosion patterns compared to expensive material loss tests.}

    abstract    = {These Lecture Notes review the formulation and application of optimization techniques based on control theory for aerodynamic shape design in both inviscid and viscous compressible flow. The theory is applied to a system defined by the partial differential equations of the flow, with the boundary shape acting as the control. The Frechet derivative of the cost function is determined via the solution of an adjoint partial differential equation, and the boundary shape is then modified in a direction of descent. This process is repeated until an optimum solution is approached. Each design cycle requires the numerical solution of both the flow and the adjoint equations, leading to a computational cost roughly equal to the cost of two flow solutions. Representative results are presented for viscous optimization of transonic wing-body combinations.}

    abstract    = {This article traces the evolution of long range jet transport aircraft over the 50 years since Kuechemann founded the journal Progress in Aerospace Sciences. The article is particularly focused on transonic aerodynamics. During Kuechemann's life time a good qualitative understanding had been achieved of transonic flow and swept wing design, but transonic flow remained intractable to quantitative prediction. During the last 50 years this situation has been completely transformed by the introduction of sophisticated numerical algorithms and an astonishing increase in the available computational power, with the consequence that aerodynamic design is now carried out largely by computer simulation. Moreover developments in aerodynamic shape optimization based on control theory enable a competitive swept wing to be designed in just two simulations, as illustrated in the article. While the external appearance of long range jet aircraft has not changed much, advances in
                  information technology have actually transformed the entire design and manufacturing process through parallel advances in computer aided design (CAD), computational structural mechanics (CSM) and multidisciplinary optimization (MDO). They have also transformed aircraft operations through the adoption of digital fly-by-wire and advanced navigational techniques.}

    abstract    = {Nonplanar lifting surfaces can lower the induced drag relative to planar surfaces by redistributing vorticity. Other sources of drag, such as viscous drag, as well as nonaerodynamic considerations, such as structural weight, also play an important role in assessing the overall efficiency of such lifting surfaces. In this paper we solve a series of problems to find optimal nonplanar lifting surfaces and to explain the various factors and tradeoffs at play. A panel method and an equivalent beam finite-element model are used to explore nonplanar lifting surfaces, while taking into account the coupling and design tradeoffs between aerodynamics and structures. Both single-discipline aerodynamic optimization and multidisciplinary aerostructural optimization problems are investigated. The design variables are chosen to give the lifting-surface arrangement as much freedom as possible. This is accomplished by allowing a number of wing segments to vary their area, taper,
                  twist, sweep, span, and dihedral, with the constraint that they must not intersect each other. Because of the complexity of the resulting design space and the presence of multiple local minima, an augmented Lagrangian particle swarm optimizer is used to solve the optimization problems. When only aerodynamics are considered, closed lifting-surface configurations, such as the box wing and joined wing, are found to be optimal. When aerostructural optimization is performed, a winglet configuration is found to be optimal when the overall span is constrained, and a wing with a raked wingtip is optimal when there is no such constraint.}

The economic and environmental sustainability of commercial aviation requires not only the design of efficient new aircraft but also consideration of the operations of these aircraft. This can be achieved by coupling the design optimization of multiple aircraft families with the simultaneous allocation of these aircraft in multiple markets. Including operational allocation of aircraft in the design stage can reduce operational inefficiencies, whereas the design of aircraft families aims at reducing costs through the use of common components and providing increased flexibility for different markets. To investigate the tradeoffs involved in designing efficient, environmentally sustainable aircraft, a coupled design optimization of two aircraft families involving uncertainties in passenger demand over multiple years of operations was conducted. The results obtained
                  show that the coupled design of aircraft families with the allocation of these aircraft to two distinct markets can significantly reduce fuel burn, as well as operating and acquisition costs, when compared to existing aircraft. The optimized aircraft also provide higher operational flexibility, with respect to variations in passenger demand, and improved performance when compared against aircraft optimized individually, taking into consideration routes being flown but decoupled from fleet allocation.}

To address this need, we present OpenAeroStruct, an open-source low-fidelity aerostructural analysis and optimization tool developed in NASA's OpenMDAO framework. It uses the coupled adjoint method to compute the derivatives required for efficient gradient-based optimization. OpenAeroStruct combines a vortex lattice method and 1-D finite-element analysis to model lifting surfaces, such as aircraft wings and tails, and uses the coupled-adjoint method to compute the aerostructural derivatives. We use the Breguet range equation to compute the fuel burn as a function of
                  structural weight and aerodynamic performance. OpenAeroStruct has proved effective both as an educational tool and as a benchmark for researching new MDO methods. There is much more potential to be exploited as the research community continues to develop and use this tool. }

    abstract    = {Aircraft are multidisciplinary systems that are challenging to design due to interactions between the subsystems. The relevant disciplines, such as aerodynamic, thermal, and propulsion systems, must be considered simultaneously using a path-dependent formulation to accurately assess aircraft performance. The overarching contribution of this work is the construction and exploration of a coupled aero-thermal-propulsive-mission multidisciplinary model to optimize supersonic aircraft considering their path-dependent performance. First, the mission, thermal, and propulsion disciplines are examined in detail. The aerostructural design and mission of a morphing-wing aircraft is optimized before the optimal flight profile for a supersonic strike mission is investigated. Then a fuel thermal management system, commonly used to dissipate excess thermal energy from supersonic aircraft, is constructed and presented. Engine design is then investigated through two main
                  applications: multipoint optimization of a variable-cycle engine and coupled thermal-engine optimization considering a bypass duct heat exchanger. This culminates into a fully-coupled path-dependent mission optimization problem considering the aerodynamic, propulsion, and thermal systems. This large-scale optimization problem captures non-intuitive design trades that single disciplinary models and path-independent methods cannot resolve. Although the focal application is a supersonic aircraft, the methods presented here are applicable to any air or space vehicle and other path-dependent problems. This level of highly-coupled design optimization considering these disciplines has not been performed before. The framework, modeling, and results from this dissertation will be useful for designers of commercial and military aircraft. Specifically, optimizing the design and trajectory of commercial aircraft to minimize fuel usage leads to a more sustainable and more
                  connected world as the rate of air travel continues to increase. The methods presented are flexible and powerful enough to design supersonic military aircraft systems, as demonstrated using an application aircraft. This dissertation has been shaped through direct collaborations with NASA, the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), and other academic institutions, which shows the broad appeal and applicability of this work to a multitude of design problems.}

A Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS) concept has been developed which offers advantages over traditional metallic structure. In this concept a stitched carbon-epoxy material system has been developed with the potential for reducing the weight and cost of transport aircraft structure by eliminating fasteners, thereby reducing part count and labor. By adding unidirectional carbon rods to the top of stiffeners, the panel becomes more structurally efficient. This combination produces a more damage tolerant design. This document describes the results of experimentation on PRSEUS specimens loaded in unidirectional compression subjected to impact damage and loaded in fatigue and to failure. A comparison with analytical predictions for pristine and damaged specimens is included.}

    abstract    = {Compared to non-cavitating flow, cavitating flow is much complex owing to the numerical difficulties caused by cavity generation and collapse. In this paper, the cavitating flow around a NACA66 hydrofoil is studied numerically with particular emphasis on understanding the cavitation structures and the shedding dynamics. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) was coupled with a homogeneous cavitation model to calculate the pressure, velocity, vapor volume fraction and vorticity around the hydrofoil. The predicted cavitation shedding dynamics behavior, including the cavity growth, break-off and collapse downstream, agrees fairly well with experiment. Some fundamental issues such as the transition of a cavitating flow structure from 2D to 3D associated with cavitation--vortex interaction are discussed using the vorticity transport equation for variable density flow. A simplified one-dimensional model for the present configuration is adopted and calibrated against the LES results
                  to better clarify the physical mechanism for the cavitation induced pressure fluctuations. The results verify the relationship between pressure fluctuations and the cavity shedding process (e.g. the variations of the flow rate and cavity volume) and demonstrate that the cavity volume acceleration is the main source of the pressure fluctuations around the cavitating hydrofoil. This research provides a better understanding of the mechanism driving the cavitation excited pressure pulsations, which will facilitate development of engineering designs to control these vibrations.}

First, the non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) free form deformation method based on NURBS basis function is introduced to the airfoil parameterization. Second, aerodynamic characteristics are evaluated by solving Navier--Stokes equations, and the γ-Reθt¯ transition model coupling with shear-stress transport (SST) turbulent model is introduced to simulate boundary layer transition. A numerical simulation of transition flow around NLF0416 airfoil is conducted to test the code. The comparison between numerical simulation results and wind tunnel test data approves the validity and applicability of the present transition model. Third, the optimization system is set up, which uses the separated particle swarm optimization (SPSO) as search algorithm and combines the Kriging models as surrogate model during optimization. The system is applied to carry out robust design about
                  the uncertainty of lift coefficient and Mach number for NASA NLF-0115 airfoil. The data of optimized airfoil aerodynamic characteristics indicates that the optimized airfoil can maintain laminar flow stably in an uncertain range and has a wider range of low drag.}

    abstract    = {A behavior is ``contagious'' if one person is more likely to exhibit it when a relevant other person has already done so. In this sense, behavioral contagion is commonly thought to contribute to many social problems, such as drug abuse and teenage promiscuity. In this paper we focus on behavioral contagion in sibships. Borrowing a model from the theory of contagious diseases, we show that contagion will cause prevalence to increase with sibship size. This model also allows us to estimate the magnitude of the contagious factor relative to non-contagious factors. Finally, we develop two statistical tests for the presence of contagion. Results are presented for participation in a skill-development program and four child-psychiatric conditions: neurosis, hyperactivity, somatization, and conduct disorder. Evidence is presented that program participation is probably contagious and conduct disorder possibly so. The other three child-psychiatric conditions are shown not to
                  be contagious. Implications for research and practice are discussed.}

The new algorithm uses the space-partitioning approach common to many Lipschitzian, interval-analysis, and Bayesian algorithms. It differs from these methods in its use of a new criterion for selecting regions for further search. This new criterion speeds up convergence by giving the algorithm the ability to perform both local and global search at the same time. Thus, once the global part of the algorithm finds the basin of convergence of the optimum, the local part quickly and automatically exploits it. The objective function is treated as a black box that need not be differentiable or Lipschitzian. Results are given for nine standard test functions.<>}

    abstract    = {Today, most successful applications of optimization in the automotive industry are at the detailed-design level. Examples include structural optimization of metal gauges and beam cross sections, topology optimization of cast parts, and engine calibration. Despite these successes, it is fair to say that optimization is used less often, and has had a smaller impact, than most researchers might have expected. The reason is the presence of numerous barriers, such as poor connections between computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided engineering (CAE) software, insufficient predictive accuracy of computer simulations, difficulty in automating and iterating computer analyses, long simulation times, and poor availability of data. As a result, until recently, the focus has just been on getting to the point where we can do optimization. Fortunately, many of these barriers are being overcome, and the next decade is likely to witness a fast growth in the use of optimization
                  within the industry. Accordingly, the focus will shift to more interesting challenges, such as robust design, multi-disciplinary optimization, and the roll-down of vehicle-level requirements to subsystem specifications.}

    abstract    = {This paper introduces a fully general, exact algorithm for nesting irregular shapes. Both the shapes and material resource can be arbitrary nonconvex polygons. Moreover, the shapes can have holes and the material can have defective areas. Finally, the shapes can be arranged using both translations and arbitrary rotations (as opposed to a finite set of rotation angles, such as 0{\$}{\$}\^{}{$\backslash$}circ {\$}{\$}∘and 180{\$}{\$}\^{}{$\backslash$}circ {\$}{\$}∘). The insight that has made all this possible is a novel way to relax the constraint that the shapes not overlap. The key idea is to inscribe a few circles in each irregular shape and then relax the non-overlap constraints for the shapes by replacing them with non-overlap constraints for the inscribed circles. These relaxed problems have the form of quadratic programming problems (QPs) and can be solved to optimality to provide valid lower bounds. Valid upper bounds can be found via local search with
                  strict non-overlap constraints. If the shapes overlap in the solution to the relaxed problem, new circles are inscribed in the shapes to prevent this overlapping configuration from recurring, and the QP is then resolved to obtain improved lower bounds. Convergence to any fixed tolerance is guaranteed in a finite number of iterations. A specialized branch-and-bound algorithm, together with some heuristics, are introduced to find the initial inscribed circles that approximate the shapes. The new approach, called ``QP-Nest,''is applied to three problems as proof of concept. The most complicated of these is a problem due to Milenkovic that has four nonconvex polygons with 94, 72, 84, and 74 vertices, respectively. QP-Nest is able prove global optimality when nesting the first two or the first three of these shapes. When all four shapes are considered, QP-Nest finds the best known solution, but cannot prove optimality.}

    abstract    = {Introduced in 1993, the DIRECT global optimization algorithm provided a fresh approach to minimizing a black-box function subject to lower and upper bounds on the variables. In contrast to the plethora of nature-inspired heuristics, DIRECT was deterministic and had only one hyperparameter (the desired accuracy). Moreover, the algorithm was simple, easy to implement, and usually performed well on low-dimensional problems (up to six-variables). Most importantly, DIRECT balanced local and global search (exploitation versus exploration) in a unique way: in each iteration, several points were sampled, some for global and some for local search. This approach eliminated the need for ``tuning parameters'' that set the balance between local and global search.
                  
                  However, the very same features that made DIRECT simple and conceptually attractive also created weaknesses. For example, it was commonly observed that, while DIRECT is often fast to find the basin of the global optimum, it can be slow to fine-tune the solution to high accuracy. In this paper, we identify several such weaknesses and survey the work of various researchers to extend DIRECT so that it performs better. All of the extensions show substantial improvement over DIRECT on various test functions. An outstanding challenge is to improve performance robustly across problems of different degrees of difficulty, ranging from simple (unimodal, few variables) to very hard (multimodal, sharply peaked, many variables). Opportunities for further improvement may lie in combining the best features of the different extensions.}

    abstract    = {Flutter is a dynamic aeroelastic instability driven by the interaction of inertial, elastic, and aerodynamic forces. It is an undesirable phenomenon in aircraft because it causes divergent oscillations that may lead to structural damage or failure, performance and ride comfort degradation, or loss of control. If flutter is discovered at the aircraft certification stage, costly redesign is required. Performing flutter analysis early in the design process can mitigate this problem. Furthermore, including flutter analysis as a constraint in multidisciplinary design optimization reduces the risk of costly modifications late in the design cycle. We review the methods for flutter analysis in the context of aircraft design optimization. We also include methods for predicting post-flutter limit cycle oscillations due to the increasing impact of nonlinear effects on future aircraft. While there has been extensive work in flutter and post-flutter analyses, developing design
                  optimization constraints associated with these analyses has additional requirements, such as acceptable computational cost, function smoothness, robustness, and derivative computation. We discuss these requirements and review efforts in the development, implementation, and application of flutter and post-flutter constraints in aircraft design optimization. We conclude the paper by summarizing the current state of this field and the main open problems. Flutter constraints have been included in structural optimizations, but optimizing both the structural sizing and the aerodynamic shape remains a challenge due to the need to recompute the aerodynamic properties at each design iteration. Additional difficulties arise in the presence of large structural deflections and transonic flow conditions due to the dependency of the flutter point on the equilibrium state and the high cost of nonlinear computations. Post-flutter constraints have rarely been included into design
                  optimization, but they are crucial in the prevention of undesirable limit cycle oscillations. Implementing such constraints requires the development of more efficient and robust prediction methods that can handle realistic configurations. While this paper focuses on flutter and post-flutter constraints for aircraft design optimization applications, the considerations and challenges are broadly applicable to the optimization of engineering systems including stability and post-critical dynamic constraints.}

    abstract    = {Higher-aspect-ratio lightweight wings can make aircraft more energy efficient thanks to induced drag reduction. Because such wings exhibit large deflections, affecting the flutter onset, design optimization using linear flutter analysis is inadequate. To address this issue, we develop a framework for including a geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint into high-fidelity, gradient-based wing structural optimization. The framework evaluates the objective function (mass) and the stress and adjacency constraints in a built-up finite element model to capture the structural details of realistic wings. This built-up finite element model is reduced to a low-order beam representation to make geometrically nonlinear flutter analysis tractable for optimization. The geometrically nonlinear flutter analysis considers the wing deformed shape at each flight condition and aggregates the associated damping values into a scalar flutter constraint. The flutter constraint is
                  differentiated with respect to the built-up structural sizing variables using the adjoint method to enable large-scale optimizations. The framework is demonstrated by minimizing the mass of a high-aspect-ratio wingbox subject to the geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint along with stress and adjacency constraints. The geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint introduces a mass penalty up to about 60\% of the baseline mass compared with the 10\% mass penalty by a linear flutter constraint based on the wing undeformed shape. This methodology can help design new-generation energy-efficient aircraft with high-aspect-ratio wings that require considering geometrically nonlinear effects early in the design cycle to prevent flutter.}

    abstract    = {Lightweight, high-aspect-ratio wings make aircraft more energy efficient thanks to their lower induced drag. Because such wings exhibit large deflections, design optimization based on linear flutter analysis of the wing undeformed shape is inadequate. To address this issue, we develop a framework for integrating a geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint, which considers in-flight deflections, into a high-fidelity gradient-based structural optimization. The wing mass and stress constraints are evaluated on a linear, built-up (detailed) finite element model to capture realistic structural features. The geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint is based on a condensed low-order beam representation of the built-up finite element model, which captures the impact of in-flight deflections with tractable computational effort for optimization. The flutter constraint is differentiated with respect to the detailed structural model sizing variables using the adjoint method
                  to enable large-scale optimizations. The framework is demonstrated by minimizing the mass of a wingbox model subject to the geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint along with stress and adjacency constraints. The geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint adds a penalty up to 60\% of the baseline mass due to the impact of in-flight deflections on the flutter onset speed and its mechanism. In contrast, a linear flutter constraint evaluated on the undeformed wing adds a mass penalty of only 10\%. This methodology can help design energy-efficient aircraft with high-aspect-ratio wings, which require geometrically nonlinear flutter analyses early in the design cycle.}

The most popular kriging method, known as ordinary kriging, uses a constant mean in the model. In this article, a modified kriging method is proposed, which has an unknown mean model. Therefore, it is called blind kriging. The unknown mean model is identified from experimental data using a Bayesian variable selection technique. Many examples are presented, which show remarkable improvement in prediction using blind kriging over ordinary kriging. Moreover, a blind kriging predictor is easier to interpret and seems to be more robust against mis-specification in the correlation parameters.}}

    abstract    = {Large-scale system design optimization is a numerical technique used in solving system design problems that involve a large number of design variables. These systems are often multidisciplinary, with many disciplines interacting with each other. The scale of these problems demands a gradient-based approach for efficient solutions, and it is often implemented by coupling an engineering model with an optimizer. A recently developed theory on multidisciplinary derivative computation has made it feasible to solve large-scale system design optimization problems in only hundreds of model evaluations. This has led to an increase in the number of applications for large-scale system design optimization with new applications still emerging. This paper presents a new optimization formulation that can further reduce the required number of model evaluations by unifying two widely used optimization architectures, namely, multidisciplinary feasible, and simultaneous analysis and
                  design. Complex engineering systems that require solutions of large nonlinear systems can potentially benefit from this new formulation, and the optimized solutions can be reached in just tens of equivalent model evaluations. We demonstrate this order of magnitude improvement using a bar design problem. The paper also provides details on the practical implementation of this new formulation in an equality-constrained optimization setting. }

To capture this trade-off, we propose simultaneous optimization of aircraft conceptual design and takeoff trajectory. Design- trajectory optimization, also called open-loop control co-design, allows us to find the optimal aircraft design that balances the flight efficiency between various flight conditions for maximum system-level performance. In this paper, we maximize the payload weight capacity of a lift-plus-cruise unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for package delivery. As a result, simultaneous optimization increases the payload weight by up to 5.3\% compared to the conventional approach, which does not couple takeoff trajectory optimization to UAV conceptual design. We identify that the cruise speed and pusher motor sizing have a significant influence on takeoff trajectory. Simultaneous
                  optimization finds the optimal cruise speed and motor sizing that enables energy-efficient wing-borne climb, which is not always possible with conventional sequential optimization.}

Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) fully considers this coupling and corresponding design trade-offs. This article discusses the computational efficiency of MDO formulations for design-trajectory optimization. We perform numerical studies to compare two MDO architectures and two design-trajectory coupling strategies on aircraft design test problems. The test problems concurrently optimize a climb trajectory, wing design based on a low-fidelity aerostructural analysis, and aircraft sizing variables. The results indicate that surrogate-based coupling is more efficient than direct coupling when there are only a few coupling variables from a trajectory to a disciplinary model, whereas direct coupling is preferable otherwise. The simultaneous
                  analysis and design (SAND) architecture outperforms the multidisciplinary feasible (MDF) architecture when using direct coupling, whereas the costs of SAND and MDF are comparable with surrogate-based coupling. The results and discussion in this paper provide general guidelines for selecting a computationally efficient MDO formulation for simultaneous design and trajectory optimization. }

    abstract    = {Pseudo-transient continuation (\${\textbackslash}Psi\$tc) is a well-known and physically motivated technique for computation of steady state solutions of time-dependent partial differential equations. Standard globalization strategies such as line search or trust region methods often stagnate at local minima. {\textbackslash}ptc succeeds in many of these cases by taking advantage of the underlying PDE structure of the problem. Though widely employed, the convergence of {\textbackslash}ptc is rarely discussed. In this paper we prove convergence for a generic form of {\textbackslash}ptc and illustrate it with two practical strategies.}

    abstract    = {High-performance composite materials exhibit both anisotropic strength and stiffness properties. These anisotropic properties can be used to produce highly-tailored aircraft structures that meet stringent performance requirements, but these properties also present unique challenges for analysis and design. New tools and techniques are developed to address some of these important challenges. A homogenization-based theory for beams is developed to accurately predict the through-thickness stress and strain distribution in thick composite beams. Numerical comparisons demonstrate that the proposed beam theory can be used to obtain highly accurate results in up to three orders of magnitude less computational time than three-dimensional calculations. Due to the large finite-element model requirements for thin composite structures used in aerospace applications, parallel solution methods are explored. A parallel direct Schur factorization method is developed. The parallel
                  scalability of the direct Schur approach is demonstrated for a large finite-element problem with over 5 million unknowns. In order to address manufacturing design requirements, a novel laminate parametrization technique is presented that takes into account the discrete nature of the ply-angle variables, and ply-contiguity constraints. This parametrization technique is demonstrated on a series of structural optimization problems including compliance minimization of a plate, buckling design of a stiffened panel and layup design of a full aircraft wing. The design and analysis of composite structures for aircraft is not a stand-alone problem and cannot be performed without multidisciplinary considerations. A gradient-based aerostructural design optimization framework is presented that partitions the disciplines into distinct process groups. An approximate Newton--Krylov method is shown to be an efficient aerostructural solution algorithm and excellent parallel
                  scalability of the algorithm is demonstrated. An induced drag optimization study is performed to compare the trade-off between wing weight and induced drag for wing tip extensions, raked wing tips and winglets. The results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a 43\% induced drag reduction with no weight penalty, a 28\% induced drag reduction with a 10\% wing weight reduction, or a 20\% wing weight reduction with a 5\% induced drag penalty from a baseline wing obtained from a structural mass-minimization problem with fixed aerodynamic loads. }

In the proposed technique, the classical laminate stiffnesses are expressed as a linear combination of the discrete options and design-variable weights. An exact l1 penalty function is employed to drive the designs towards discrete, 0-1 designs. The proposed tech- nique can be used as either an alternative or as an enhancement to SIMP-type methods, such as discrete material optimization (DMO). Unlike mixed-integer approaches, our laminate parametrization technique is well suited for gradient-based design optimization. The proposed laminate parametrization is demonstrated on compliance design of laminated plates and buckling design of a laminated stiffened panel. The results demonstrate that the approach is an effective alternative to DMO methods.}

    abstract    = {Current and future composite material technologies have the potential to greatly improve the performance of large transport aircraft. However, the coupling between aerodynamics and structures makes it challenging to design optimal flexible wings, and the transonic flight regime requires high fidelity computational models. We address these challenges by solving a series of high-fidelity aerostructural optimization problems that explore the design space for the wing of a large transport aircraft. We consider three different materials: aluminum, carbon-fiber reinforced composites and an hypothetical composite based on carbon nanotubes. The design variables consist of both aerodynamic shape (including span), structural sizing, and ply angle fractions in the case of composites. Pareto fronts with respect to structural weight and fuel burn are generated. The wing performance in each case is optimized subject to stress and buckling constraints. We found that composite wings
                  consistently resulted in lower fuel burn and lower structural weight, and that the carbon nanotube composite did not yield the increase in performance one would expect from a material with such outstanding properties. This indicates that there might be diminishing returns when it comes to the application of advanced materials to wing design, requiring further investigation. }

In this paper we evaluate the suitability of the CRM for aerostructural and aeroelastic optimization studies. Since the CRM was originally intended for aerodynamic studies only, the undeformed geometry is not available. To address this issue, we designed a jig shape and the corresponding wingbox structure for the CRM using an inverse design procedure. The results are verified by computing the drag coefficient of the aerostructural solution with the jig shape at the nominal CRM operating conditions. The drag differs by less than one drag count relative to the CRM original shape. Using the CRM jig geometry, a sample high-fidelity aerostructural optimization is performed to determine the potential decrease in fuel burn for a long-range design mission when varying wing planform and airfoil shapes. The
                  optimization increases the aspect ratio of the wing from 9.0 to 12.6 and reduces the fuel burn by 8.8\%. We also perform a series of gust load analysis on both the initial and optimized designs and determine that the optimized structure is critical under gust loads. The aerostructural optimization produces a high aspect ratio wing with effective passive aeroelastic tailoring, but additional load cases with cruise-like lift distributions are required to produce a more realistic wing design.}

The aerostructural analysis employs Euler CFD with a 2 million cell mesh and a structural finite element model with 300 000 degrees of freedom. The coupled adjoint sensitivity method is used to efficiently compute gradients, enabling the use of gradient-based optimization with respect to hundreds of aerodynamic shape and structural sizing variables. The NASA Common Research Model is used as the baseline configuration, together with a wingbox structure that was designed for this study. Two design optimization problems are solved: one where takeoff gross weight is minimized, and another where fuel burn is minimized. Each optimization uses a multi-point formulation with 5 cruise conditions and 2 maneuver conditions. Each of the optimization problems have 476 design variables, including wing planform, airfoil shape, and
                  structural thickness variables. Optimized results are obtained within 36 hours of wall time using 435 processors. The resulting optimal configurations are discussed and analyzed for the aerostructural trade-offs resulting from each objective.

    abstract    = {Structured mesh computational fluid dynamic solvers are inherently faster than unstructured solvers, which is particularly advantageous for aerodynamic design optimization, where hundreds of flow solutions are required. However, generating body-fitted multiblock meshes for complex geometries is challenging and is a time consuming task. The overset mesh technique greatly reduces the manual effort required to generate meshes over complex geometries by overlapping a series of simpler meshes. However, generating the necessary connectivity information between meshes in a robust and computationally efficient manner remains a challenge. We address this challenge by developing an efficient parallel overset grid assembly technique based on implicit hole cutting that is fully automatic. The method is fully parallel and scales to hundreds of processors. Several optimizations of the Common Research Model wing-body-tail configuration are performed using the meshes generated by
                  our technique. We compare the best drag reduction obtained from multiblock and overset meshes using two different artificial dissipation schemes. The smooth, highly orthogonal overset meshes produce better results than the multiblock meshes, by up to 3 drag counts. An application to rotorcraft design is also presented. The demonstrated meshing flexibility and accurate transonic solutions make the overset mesh technique ideally suited for aerodynamic shape optimization.}

Although aerodynamic shape optimization has the potential to produce high-performance transonic wing designs, these designs remain susceptible to buffet. To address this issue, a separation-based constraint formulation is developed that constrains buffet onset in an aerodynamic shape optimization. This separation metric is verified against a common buffet prediction method and validated against experimental wind-tunnel data. A series of optimizations based on the AIAA Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group's wing--body--tail case are presented to show that buffet-onset constraints are required and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Although both single-point and multipoint optimizations without separation
                  constraints are vulnerable to buffeting, the optimizations using the proposed approach move the buffet boundary to make the designs feasible.

    abstract    = {The adjoint method is used for high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization and is an efficient approach for computing the derivatives of a function of interest with respect to a large number of design variables. Over the past few decades, various approaches have been used to implement the adjoint method in computational fluid dynamics solvers. However, further advances in the field are hindered by the lack of performance assessments that compare the various adjoint implementations. Therefore, we propose open benchmarks and report a comprehensive evaluation of the various approaches to adjoint implementation. We also make recommendations on effective approaches, that is, approaches that are efficient, accurate, and have a low implementation cost. We focus on the discrete adjoint method and describe adjoint implementations for two computational fluid dynamics solvers by using various methods for computing the partial derivatives in the adjoint equations and for
                  solving those equations. Both source code transformation and operator-overloading algorithmic differentiation tools are used to compute the partial derivatives, along with finite differencing. We also examine the use of explicit Jacobian and Jacobian-free solution methods. We quantitatively evaluate the speed, scalability, memory usage, and accuracy of the various implementations by running cases that cover a wide range of Mach numbers, Reynolds numbers, mesh topologies, mesh sizes, and CPU cores. We conclude that the Jacobian-free method using source code transformation algorithmic differentiation to compute the partial derivatives is the best option because it computes exact derivatives with the lowest CPU time and the lowest memory requirements, and it also scales well up to 10 million cells and over one thousand CPU cores. The superior performance of this approach is primarily due to its Jacobian-free adjoint strategy. The cases presented herein are publicly
                  available and represent platform-independent benchmarks for comparing other current and future adjoint implementations. Our results and discussion provide a guide for discrete adjoint implementations, not only for computational fluid dynamics but also for a wide range of other partial differential equation solvers.}

The computation of aerodynamic performance parameters includes a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes CFD solver, coupling to a linear static structural analysis using the finite element method to take into account aero-elastic effects. Aerodynamic performance gradients are computed using the adjoint approach. Within each optimization iteration, the wing's structure is sized via a gradient-based algorithm and an updated structure model is forwarded for the performance analysis. In this pilot study wing profile shape is optimized in order to study engine installation effects. This setting was able to improve the aerodynamic performance by 4\%.}

    abstract    = {Drones are one of the most intensively studied technologies in logistics in recent years. They combine technological features matching current trends in transport industry and society like autonomy, flexibility, and agility. Among the various concepts for using drones in logistics, parcel delivery is one of the most popular application scenarios. Companies like Amazon test drones particularly for last-mile delivery intending to achieve both reducing total cost and increasing customer satisfaction by fast deliveries. As drones are electric vehicles, they are also often claimed to be an eco-friendly mean of transportation. In this paper an energy consumption model for drones is proposed to describe the energy demand for drone deliveries depending on environmental conditions and the flight pattern. The model is used to simulate the energy demand of a stationary parcel delivery system which serves a set customers from a depot. The energy consumed by drones is compared to
                  the energy demand of Diesel trucks and electric trucks serving the same customers from the same depot. The results indicate that switching to a solely drone-based parcel delivery system is not worthwhile from an energetic perspective in most scenarios. A stationary drone-based parcel delivery system requires more energy than a truck-based parcel delivery system particularly in urban areas where customer density is high and truck tours are comparatively short. In rather rural settings with long distances between customers, a drone-based parcel delivery system creates an energy demand comparable to a parcel delivery system with electric trucks provided environmental conditions are moderate.}

    abstract    = {Mesh generation in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is one of the most critical and time consuming parts of the analysis process. Cartesian cut-cell methods with adjoint based adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) have been used on inviscid problems to automate the meshing procedure for arbitrary geometries. However, these methods struggle with viscous equations because they lack a robust way to account for varying scales in spatial dimensions. A Viscous Aerodynamic Cartesian Cut-cell (VACC) toolbox has been developed to facilitate Cartesian cut-cell research on high Reynolds number viscous flows. We found that directional limiters perform better than scalar limiters for maintaining accuracy and total variation diminishing solutions. Implicit residual smoothing and variations of the Runge-Kutta time marching scheme proved effective for accelerating our explicit time marching scheme. VACC shows excellent parallel scaling. This paper outlines the progress made so far on the
                  mesh generator and the flow solver.}

    abstract    = {Generating a computational mesh often consumes considerable time for the user during the analysis process. This can be circumvented by using cut-cell mesh generation techniques to automatically generate meshes. Previously, we developed Viscous Aerodynamic Cartesian Cut-cells (VACC), a toolbox for solving the laminar Navier--Stokes equations. In this work, we extend VACC to include the Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations with the Spalart--Allmaras (SA) turbulence model. We present a novel Eikonal solver that utilizes 2D unconstrained optimizations with variable bounds at every step of a fast marching method to improve accuracy on non-uniform meshes. We implemented a constant forcing distance wall function to reduce the need for anisotropic elements near the body with high Reynolds numbers. The generality of the Eikonal solver is demonstrated on several configurations with deep concavities and sharp convexities. The SA formulation is demonstrated with
                  preliminary investigations of rotated flat plates and 2D bump-in-channel case from the NASA Turbulence Modeling Resource website with skin friction and eddy viscosity that compares well with CFL3D.}

Here we present experiments that demonstrate self-verifying, hybrid, variational quantum simulation of lattice models in condensed matter and high-energy physics. In contrast to analogue quantum simulation, this approach forgoes the requirement of realizing the targeted Hamiltonian directly in the laboratory, thus enabling the study of a wide variety of previously intractable target models. We focus on the lattice Schwinger model, a gauge theory of one-dimensional quantum electrodynamics. Our quantum co-processor is a programmable, trapped-ion analogue quantum simulator with up to 20 qubits, capable of generating families of entangled trial states respecting the symmetries of the target Hamiltonian. We determine ground states, energy gaps and additionally, by
                  measuring variances of the Schwinger Hamiltonian, we provide algorithmic errors for the energies, thus taking a step towards verifying quantum simulation.}

    abstract    = {In order to mitigate the impact of the growing gap between CPU speed and main memory performance, today's computer architectures implement hierarchical memory structures. The idea behind this approach is to hide both the low main memory bandwidth and the latency of main memory accesses which is slow in contrast to the floating-point performance of the CPUs. Usually, there is a small and expensive high speed memory sitting on top of the hierarchy which is usually integrated within the processor chip to provide data with low latency and high bandwidth; i.e., the CPU registers. Moving further away from the CPU, the layers of memory successively become larger and slower. The memory components which are located between the processor core and main memory are called cache memories or caches. They are intended to contain copies of main memory blocks to speed up accesses to frequently needed data [378], [392]. The next lower level of the memory hierarchy is the main memory
                  which is large but also comparatively slow. While external memory such as hard disk drives or remote memory components in a distributed computing environment represent the lower end of any common hierarchical memory design, this paper focuses on optimization techniques for enhancing cache performance.}

    abstract    = {Composite materials are being used more frequently for marine applications due to the advantages of a higher stiffness- and strength-to-weight ratio, and better corrosion resistance compared to metallic alloys. Many examples consist of cantilevered structures, such as hydrofoils, propeller and turbine blades, keels, and rudders. A wide range of analytical and numerical tools exist for the free vibration analysis of composite structures in air due to their applicability to design problems in the aerospace industry, such as airplane wings, turbofan and propeller blades, and flight control surfaces. For these aerospace structures the inertial effects of the fluid are typically neglected due to the low relative density of air compared to the structure. Contrarily, for marine structures, fluid inertial (added mass) effects cannot be neglected, especially for composites with much higher fluid-to-solid density ratios. The objective of this work is to investigate the effects
                  of material anisotropy and added mass on the free vibration response of rectangular, cantilevered composite plates/beams via combined analytical and numerical modeling. The results show that the natural frequencies of the composite plate are 50{\^a}70\% lower in water than in air due to large added mass effects. The added mass is found to vary considerably with material orientation due to the bend-twist coupling of anisotropic composites, which affects the mode shapes and, consequently, the fluid inertial loads. The analytical method is found to yield accurate results for beam geometries and offers significant savings in computational cost compared to the finite element method.}

    abstract    = {Numerical simulation is already an important cornerstone for aircraft design, although the application of highly accurate methods is mainly limited to the design point. To meet future technical, economic and social challenges in aviation, it is essential to simulate a real aircraft at an early stage, including all multidisciplinary interactions covering the entire flight envelope, and to have the ability to provide data with guaranteed accuracy required for development and certification. However, despite the considerable progress made there are still significant obstacles to be overcome in the development of numerical methods, physical modeling, and the integration of different aircraft disciplines for multidisciplinary analysis and optimization of realistic aircraft configurations. At DLR, these challenges are being addressed in the framework of the multidisciplinary project Digital-X (4/2012--12/2015). This paper provides an overview of the project objectives and
                  presents first results on enhanced disciplinary methods in aerodynamics and structural analysis, the development of efficient reduced order methods for load analysis, the development of a multidisciplinary optimization process based on a multi-level/variable-fidelity approach, as well as the development and application of multidisciplinary methods for the analysis of maneuver loads.}

Only major types of aircraft are considered and some of the characteristic features which distinguish them are described. The types are: classical and swept aircraft for flight at subsonic and low supersonic speeds; slender wings for flight at supersonic speeds and also for subsonic flight over very short ranges; and waverider aircraft for flight at hypersonic speeds. The prospects for further development of the existing types and for the establishment of the as yet hypothetical types are discussed. The evolution of the aerodynamic shape is shown to lead to a complete spectrum of major types of aircraft, supplemented by special types designed for particular purposes.}

An efficient one-dimensional GO method using local tuning on the behavior of the objective function is generalized to the multi-dimensional case by the diagonal approach using two partition strategies. Global convergence conditions are established for the obtained diagonal geometric methods. Results of a wide numerical comparison show a strong acceleration reached by the new methods working with estimates of the local Lipschitz constants over different subregions of the search domain in comparison with the traditional approach.}

    abstract    = {In this paper, the problem of global tuning of fuzzy power-system stabilizers (FPSSs) present in a multi-machine power system in order to damp the power system oscillations is considered. In particular, it is formulated as a problem of global minimization of a multiextremal black-box function over a multidimensional hyperinterval. A global optimization technique, recently proposed, is used for solving the stated problem: the search hyperinterval is partitioned into smaller hyperintervals and the objective function is evaluated only at two vertices corresponding to the main diagonal of the generated hyperintervals, thus avoiding unnecessary ponderous simulations. Then, the performances of this technique are numerically compared with ones of a genetic algorithm (GA).}

The geometry of these test objects varied in the spanwise direction (i.e. three-dimensional test objects). Closed cavities formed on these test objects. The interface of the closed cavities curved smoothly to form a re-entrant jet at the cavity terminus, and the re-entrant flow was directed spanwise, thus preventing its impingement on the cavity interface. The cavity shape and the pressure gradients near the closure of the closed cavities were qualitatively similar to those predicted with the two-dimensional free-streamline theory. These cavities had a steady, laminar flow reattachment. The flow around the closed cavity was largely irrotational.}

This paper presents the extended design structure matrix (XDSM), a new diagram for visualizing MDO processes. The diagram is based on extending the standard design structure matrix (DSM) to simultaneously show data dependency and process flow on a single diagram. Modifications include adding special components to define iterative processes, defining different line styles to show data and process connections independently, and adding a numbering scheme to define the order in which the components are executed. This paper describes the rules for constructing XDSMs along with many examples, including diagrams of several MDO
                  archi-tectures. Finally, this paper discusses potential applications of the XDSM in other areas of MDO and the future development of the diagrams.}

However, it is not always clear which constraint aggregation method is more effective, and which values to use for the aggregation parameters. In this work, the accuracy and efficiency of several aggregation methods are compared for an aircraft wing design problem. The effect of the type of aggregation function, the number of constraints, and the value of the aggregation parameter are studied. Recommendations are provided for selecting a constraint aggregation scheme that balances computational effort with the accuracy of the computed optimal design. Using the recommended aggregation method and associated parameters, a mass of within 0.5\% of the true optimal design was obtained. }

New techniques that couple CFD solvers to thermodynamic cycle analyses showed increased robustness and proved the viability of a fully coupled approach using gradient-based optimization. However, existing work in this area has been limited to simple benchmark cases and does not contain complete engine models. In this study, we extend these methodologies beyond an electrically driven propulsor to consider a complete high-bypass turbofan engine. The high-bypass turbofan model incorporates CFD and thermodynamic cycle sub-systems into a unified model for aeropropulsive design optimization by utilizing multiple coupling techniques from prior benchmark aeropropulsive cases. We present a high-bypass turbofan design optimized for thrust specific fuel consumption with respect to coupling, geometric, and practical design constraints using this coupled
                  approach. The integration of high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization with one-dimensional cycle modeling on a large scale is a major milestone for coupled propulsion system design. These developments advance the use of coupled aeropropulsive optimization earlier in the design cycle for propulsion systems.}

Aeropropulsive design optimization considers the multidisciplinary coupled interactions between aerodynamics, thermodynamics, and geometry. Mixed-fidelity aeropropulsive methods integrate high-fidelity aerodynamic solvers with zero-dimensional thermodynamic cycle modeling. Combined with gradient-based optimization, this approach is a computationally efficient design tool that can accommodate large design spaces with many design variables and constraints. Previously, we developed a novel hybrid aeropropulsive coupling method for turbofan engines and demonstrated its feasibility using a single-design-point problem. In this work, we improve upon the prior approach and perform the first successful coupled aeropropulsive optimization of a high-bypass turbofan. We analyze the optimized turbofan design

    abstract    = {Coded aperture imaging (CAI) has evolved as a standard technique for imaging high-energy photon sources and has found numerous applications. Coded aperture arrays (CAAs) are the most important devices in the applications of CAI. In recent years, many approaches were presented to design optimum or near-optimum CAAs. Uniformly redundant arrays (URAs) are the most successful CAAs for their cyclic autocorrelation consisting of a sequence of delta functions on a flat sidelobe, which can easily be subtracted when the object has been reconstructed. Unfortunately, the existing methods can only be used to design URAs with limited number of array sizes and fixed autocorrelative sidelobe-to-peak ratio. In this paper, we presented a method to design more flexible URAs by means of a global optimization algorithm named DIRECT. By our approaches, we obtain various types of URAs including the filled URAs which can be constructed by existing methods and the sparse URAs which have
                  never been constructed and mentioned by existing papers as far as we know.}

This book has served this purpose well. Numerical analysts, statisticians, and engineers have developed techniques and nomenclature for the least squares problems of their own discipline. This well-organized presentation of the basic material needed for the solution of least squares problems can unify this divergence of methods. Mathematicians, practising engineers, and scientists will welcome its return to print. The material covered includes Householder and Givens orthogonal transformations, the QR and SVD decompositions, equality constraints, solutions in nonnegative variables, banded problems, and updating methods for sequential estimation. Both the theory and practical algorithms are included. The easily understood explanations and the appendix providing a review of basic linear algebra make the book accessible
                  for the non-specialist.}

    abstract    = {Aerodynamic Shape Optimization using Discrete Adjoint Formulation based on Overset Mesh System Discrete Adjoint Approach;Overset Mesh Technique;Optimal Shape Design;S-BIG(Spline-Boundary Intersection Grid);Complex Geometry; A new design approach of complex geometries such as wing/body configuration is arranged by using overset mesh techniques under large scale computing environment. For an in-depth study of the flow physics and highly accurate design, several special overlapped structured blocks such as collar grid, tip-cap grid, and etc. which are commonly used in refined drag prediction are adopted to consider the applicability of the present design tools to practical problems. Various pre- and post-processing techniques for overset flow analysis and sensitivity analysis are devised or implemented to resolve overset mesh techniques into the design optimization problem based on Gradient Based Optimization Method (GBOM). In the pre-processing, the convergence
                  characteristics of the flow solver and sensitivity analysis are improved by overlap optimization method. Moreover, a new post-processing method, Spline-Boundary Intersecting Grid (S-BIG) scheme, is proposed by considering the ratio of cell area for more refined prediction of aerodynamic coefficients and efficient evaluation of their sensitivities under parallel computing environment. With respect to the sensitivity analysis, discrete adjoint formulations for overset boundary conditions are derived by a full hand-differentiation. A smooth geometric modification on the overlapped surface boundaries and evaluation of grid sensitivities can be performed by mapping from planform coordinate to the surface meshes with Hicks-Henne function. Careful design works for the drag minimization problems of a transonic wing and a wing/body configuration are performed by using the newly-developed and -applied overset mesh techniques. The results from design applications demonstrate the
                  capability of the present design approach successfully.}

    abstract    = {The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analyses were performed to obtain the structural responses of 3D wind turbine research on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Phase VI wind turbine using the commercial program ANSYS. The surface pressure information was imported from the results of computation fluid dynamics (CFD) which were studied in advance. To perform the structural analyses for both of FSI and blade element momentum (BEM) method, the structural model of full NREL Phase VI wind turbine were developed which is assembled by a rotor, nacelle, tower and blades. The aerodynamic forces also can be calculated from structural model by the value of reaction on rotor shaft. From those new aerodynamic evaluating process, the accuracy of FSI process which utilizing CFD results were described. And the advantages and characteristics of combination of CFD/FSI which were demonstrated by investigating the structural response of NREL Phase VI turbine for 7 wind
                  speed cases. From the studies of structural analysis, the wind turbine can be said that it is not governed by torque force, which is the main interest in power efficiency of wind turbine, but the thrust force. Finally, the practical applicability of this methodology is discussed.}

    abstract    = {The idea of using distributed propulsion has been suggested with the objective of reducing aircraft noise. This paper investigates the effects of such a system on aircraft performance and weight. The distributed propulsion concept considered here involves replacing a small number of large engines with a moderate number of small engines and ducting part of the engine exhaust to exit out along the trailing edge of the wing. Models to describe the effects of this distributed propulsion concept were formulated and integrated into a multidisciplinary design optimization formulation. The most important effect modeled is the impact on the propulsive efficiency when there is blowing out of the trailing edge of a wing. An increase in propulsive efficiency is attainable with this arrangement as the trailing edge jet `fills in' the wake behind the body, improving the overall aerodynamic/propulsion system, resulting in an increased propulsive efficiency. Other models formulated
                  include the effect of the trailing edge jet on the induced drag, longitudinal control through thrust vectoring of the trailing edge jet, increased weight due to the ducts, and thrust losses within the ducts. The Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) aircraft was used as a testbed in this study. Two different BWB configurations were optimized, a conventional propulsion BWB with four pylon mounted engines and a distributed propulsion BWB with eight boundary layer ingestion inlet engines, for a mission of 7750 nm at Mach 0.85 carrying 478 passengers. The results show that the optimum BWB designs have comparable planform shapes and TOGW of approximately 860,000 lb, but have different weight distributions. The distributed propulsion BWB has a heavier propulsion system (+17.5\%) and a lighter wing (−11.5\%) than the conventional propulsion BWB. Although the distributed propulsion BWB has a 1.6\% higher lift-to-drag ratio than the conventional propulsion BWB, the fuel weight is still
                  1.2\% higher, mainly due to 3.8\% higher specific fuel consumption associated with smaller turbofan engines. The results furthermore show that more than two-thirds of the possible savings due to filling in the wake will be required to obtain this optimum design. Achieving such high savings by filling in the wake will be challenging. However, by developing more efficient small turbofan engines and reducing the distributed propulsion system weight, the necessary savings by filling in the wake will be achieved.}

    abstract    = {Dimensioning and assessment of a specific wind turbine imply iterative steps for design optimization, as well as load calculations and performance analyses of the system in various environmental conditions. However, due to the complexity of wind turbine systems, fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic codes are indispensable to represent and simulate the non-linear system behavior. To cope with the large number of simulations to be performed during the design process of a wind turbine system, automation of simulation executions and optimization procedures are required. In this paper, such a holistic simulation and optimization framework is presented, by which means iterative simulations within the wind turbine design assessment and development processes can be managed and executed in an automated and high-performance manner. The focus lies on the application to design load case simulations, as well as the realization of automated optimizations. The proper functioning
                  and the high flexibility of the framework tool is shown based on three exemplary optimization tasks.}

A previously developed genetic algorithm for laminate design is thoroughly revised and improved, by incorporating knowledge of the physics of the problem into the genetic algorithm. Constraints are accounted for by combining fixed and progressive penalty functions. Improved selection, mutation, and permutation operators are proposed. The use of an operator called scaling mutation that projects designs toward the feasible domain is investigated. The improvements in the genetic algorithm are shown to reduce the average price of a genetic search by more than 50\%.}

    abstract    = {Surrogate-based optimization is criticized in high-dimensional cases because it cannot scale well with the input dimension. In order to overcome this issue, we adopt a snapshot active subspace method to reduce the input dimension. A smoothing operation of samples is used to reduce the demand for snapshots in the construction of active subspaces. This operation significantly reduces the computational cost on the one hand, and on the other hand, it leads to more feasible subspaces. We use a 90{\^a}{\OE}95{\%} energy coverage criterion to define the dimension of the subspace. With this criterion, the surrogate-based airfoil optimization in the active subspace is both efficient and effective. We also validate this optimization approach in an ONERA M6 wing optimization case with 220 shape variables. Compared with original surrogate-based optimization, the new approach reduces the computational time by 70{\%} and obtains a more practical design with a smaller drag.}

    abstract    = {Aerodynamic shape optimization based on computational fluid dynamics has the potential to become more widely used in the industry; however, the optimized shapes are often criticized for not being practical. Techniques seeking more practical results, such as multipoint optimization and geometric constraints, are either ineffective or too time consuming because they require trial and error. We propose a data-driven constraint for the aerodynamic shape optimization of aircraft wings that ensures the overall practicality of the optimum shape, with a focus on achieving a good low-speed performance. The constraint is formulated by extracting the relevant features from an airfoil database via modal analysis, correlation analysis, and Gaussian mixture models. The optimization results demonstrated that this approach addresses the thin leading edge issue that had plagued previous optimization results, and further analysis demonstrated that this data-driven constraint ensures
                  good low-speed off-design performance without sacrificing the transonic on-design performance. The proposed approach can use other airfoil databases and can even be generalized to other shape optimization and engineering design problems.}

    abstract    = {Airfoils are of great importance in aerodynamic design, and various tools have been developed to evaluate and optimize their performance. Existing tools are usually either accurate or efficient, but not both. This paper presents a tool that can analyze airfoils in both subsonic and transonic regimes in about one-hundredth of a second, and optimize airfoil shapes in a few seconds. Camber and thickness mode shapes derived from over 1000 existing airfoils are used to parameterize the airfoil shape, which reduces the number of design variables. More than 100,000 Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) evaluations associated with different airfoils and flow conditions are used to train a surrogate model that combines gradient-enhanced kriging, partial least squares, and mixture of experts. These surrogate models provide fast aerodynamic analysis and gradient computation, which are coupled with a gradient-based optimizer to perform rapid airfoil shape design optimization.
                  When comparing the surrogate-based optimization with optimization based on direct RANS evaluations, the largest differences in minimum Cd are 0.04 counts for subsonic cases and 2.5 counts for transonic cases. This approach opens the door for interactive airfoil analysis and design optimization using any modern computer or mobile device.

    abstract    = {Surrogate-based optimization has been used in aerodynamic shape optimization, but it has been limited due to the curse of dimensionality. Although a large number of variables are required for the shape parameterization, many of the shapes that the parameterization can produce are abnormal and do not add meaningful information to a surrogate model. To improve the efficiency of surrogate-based optimization, recent machine learning techniques are applied in this study to reduce the abnormality of both initial and infill samples. This paper proposes a new sampling method for airfoils and wings, which is based on a deep convolutional generative adversarial network. This network is trained to learn the underlying features among the existing airfoils and is able to generate sample airfoils that are notably more realistic than those generated by other sampling methods. In addition, a discriminative model is developed based on convolutional neural networks. This model detects
                  the geometric abnormality of airfoils or wing sections quickly without using expensive computational fluid dynamic models. These machine learning models are embedded in a surrogate-based aerodynamic optimization framework and perform aerodynamic shape optimization for airfoils and wings. The results demonstrate that, compared with the conventional methods, our proposed models can double the optimization efficiency.

    abstract    = {Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly used to aid aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO), thanks to the availability of aerodynamic data and continued developments in deep learning. We review the applications of ML in ASO to date and provide a perspective on the state-of-the-art and future directions. We first introduce conventional ASO and current challenges. Next, we introduce ML fundamentals and detail ML algorithms that have been successful in ASO. Then, we review ML applications to ASO, addressing three aspects: compact geometric design space, fast aerodynamic analysis, and efficient optimization architecture. In addition to providing a comprehensive summary of the research, we comment on the practicality and effectiveness of the developed methods. We show how cutting-edge ML approaches can benefit ASO and address challenging demands, such as interactive design optimization. Practical large-scale design optimizations remain a challenge because of the high
                  cost of ML training. Further research on coupling ML model construction with prior experience and knowledge, such as physics-informed ML, is recommended to solve large-scale ASO problems. }

    abstract    = {The convergence of high-order methods, such as recently developed spectral difference (SD) method, can be accelerated using both implicit temporal advancement and a p-multigrid (p=polynomial degree) approach. A p-multigrid method is investigated in this paper for solving SD formulations of the scalar wave and Euler equations on unstructured grids. A fast preconditioned lower--upper symmetric Gauss--Seidel (LU-SGS) relaxation method is implemented as an iterative smoother. Meanwhile, a Runge--Kutta explicit method is employed for comparison. The multigrid method considered here is nonlinear and utilizes full approximation storage (FAS) [Ta'asan S. Multigrid one-shot methods and design strategy, Von Karman Institute Lecture Note, 1997 [28]] scheme. For some p-multigrid calculations, blending implicit and explicit smoothers for different p-levels is also studied. The p-multigrid method is firstly validated by solving both linear and nonlinear 2D wave equations. Then the
                  same idea is extended to 2D nonlinear Euler equations. Generally speaking, we are able to achieve speedups of up to two orders using the p-multigrid method with the implicit smoother.}

A set of parametric studies are performed to investigate the influence of fiber orientation on the vibration characteristics and load-dependent bend-twist coupled behavior of composite hydrofoils in viscous flow. A 3-D Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) solver is coupled with a 3-D finite-element method (FEM) to predict the fluid--structure response of cantilevered composite hydrofoils made of unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). Fiber orientation changes the modal characteristics of composite hydrofoils, as well as the hydroelastic response. The bending-up and nose-down material bend-twist coupling leads to lower hydrodynamic load coefficients with increasing flow speed, as well as delayed separation, stall, and static divergence. The opposite trend is observed when the fiber orientation results in
                  a bending-up and nose-up material bend-twist coupling. Material failure index contours show that the fiber orientation affects the location of failure. These parametric studies provide guidance for future design and optimization of composite hydrodynamic lifting surfaces.}

    abstract    = {Composite materials have become prevalent in hydrofoil design due to their favorable characteristics. Both material anisotropy and planform sweep are factors that affect hydrofoil performance. However, the interplay between these two factors has not been studied systematically. This paper investigates this interplay in the viscous hydroelastic response of linearly tapered composite hydrofoils with a modified NACA 0009 cross-section using high-fidelity hydrostructural simulations. The simulations are based on a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solver coupled to a structural finite-element model. Both sweep and off-axial fiber layup reduce the bending-mode natural frequencies due to the decrease in bending rigidity. Sweep reduces the form drag by suppressing trailing edge separation, but it can increase the lift-induced drag by causing the spanwise load distribution to deviate away from the ideal elliptical distribution. The spanwise load distribution can be tailored to
                  reduce the induced drag and delay cavitation inception using sweep-induced geometric, material-induced bend-twist coupling, or both. Nevertheless, a poor combination of sweep and material configurations can accelerate static divergence, early separation, cavitation, noise, and material failures. Besides changing the structural response and resultant fluid-structure interaction, the material failure inception load and failure location depend directly on the fiber orientation due to the anisotropic characteristic of composites.}

    abstract    = {To improve efficiency, functionality, and reliability of hydrodynamic lifting surfaces, such as propeller blades, control surfaces, and hydrofoils, composite materials are increasingly used because of their high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and desired fatigue properties. Despite these superior properties, their design remains challenging for maritime applications due to the need to operate over a broad range of flow conditions, and associated complex physics, including separation, cavitation, high loading, and complex material failure mechanisms. Additionally, considering both the coupling between fluid forces and structural responses, and the interplay effects between the many geometry and material design variables, the optimal design is not intuitive. Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) is a powerful tool that can tackle these design challenges by considering various design requirements simultaneously and effectively evaluating the
                  tradeoffs. With advances in computing, it is possible to use coupled high-fidelity hydrostructural simulations to better capture the flow physics and predict the structural failure onset. However, using high-fidelity simulations with MDO is still limited due to the high computational cost, especially when considering a large number of design variables needed for composite hydrodynamic lifting surfaces with complex geometries and material configurations. The objective of this dissertation is to use an efficient high-fidelity MDO framework to explore the design of composite hydrodynamic lifting surfaces and examine relevant design and research questions that are important but still unresolved so far. To address the issue of high computational cost, this dissertation uses a gradient-based optimization approach and leverages the adjoint method to compute the gradient efficiently. The contributions of this dissertation are the development of methods that optimize composite
                  hydrodynamic lifting surface designs. Optimizations are performed to yield novel findings on the tradeoffs and coupling effects between design conditions and design variables. First, a more effective cavitation constraint, a solid composite element for the structural solver, and the corresponding failure initiation criteria are implemented in the framework. Second, this dissertation pioneers the use of a displacement constraint as a surrogate for dynamic loading consideration to yield a safer and more reliable design. With these developments, this dissertation presents an optimized composite hydrofoil with significantly delayed cavitation inception. A series of optimization studies are conducted to investigate how planform variables, material configurations, and failure initiation model uncertainties affect composite lifting surface designs. This dissertation also advances the methodology to consider a more complex detailed geometry problem -- optimization of a
                  structure with junction shape, which commonly exists and is critical to the overall performance. Specifically, this is demonstrated and investigated with hydrodynamic optimization of a hydrofoil-strut system. These optimization studies show the framework can adjust the junction shape to avoid junction cavitation and flow separation, all while improving efficiency. The framework and presented optimization studies in this dissertation demonstrate the usefulness of the developed methods for hydrodynamic lifting surface designs. The discussions also provide valuable insights for designers and future research. }

Composites, even with state-of-the-art coatings, are susceptible to cavitation erosion damage. This work aims to design a cavitation-free composite lifting surface to maximize efficiency while ensuring structural integrity. We optimize a canonical hydrofoil using a gradient-based optimization framework that couples a Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes solver with a finite-element structural solver. The optimization reduces the weighted drag coefficient by 1.2\% over lift coefficients between 0.2 and 0.6, and increases the cavitation inception speed by 82\% at the nominal condition compared to the baseline. The optimized design shows higher cavitation inception speeds than an Eppler hydrofoil (E1127, known for cavitation-free operation at moderate lift conditions) with the same baseline planform at CL >= 0.2. The improvement from the E1127 hydrofoil was due mostly
                  to delaying tip vortex cavitation induced by 3-D effects. The optimization finds the fiber angle to balance the bend-twist coupling and modifies the directional strength to reduce the susceptibility to excessive deformation and material failure when sweep presents.}

High-fidelity simulations are necessary to capture critical physics near these regions, such as separation, junction vortices, and cavitation. We present RANS-based hydrodynamic optimizations of a T-shaped hydrofoil, including changes in the junction geometry. The optimized hydrofoils avoid separation and delay cavitation compared to the baseline. The full optimization design with planform, cross-section, and junction geometry variables yields a total drag reduction of 6.4\%. The optimized results show that the relative locations of the maximum foil thickness and the maximum strut thickness significantly impact the junction cavitation. Including the translation between the strut and the foil and more strut geometric variables as design variables will provide further improvement. The comparison between optimized designs demonstrates that optimizing planform and detailed junction geometry provides further
                  improvement in addition to designing the cross-sectional geometry. The Hydrostructural analyses show that the optimized T-foils have lower stress at the junction than the baseline because of the resultant junction fairing. However, these hydrodynamic-optimized T-foils have higher deformation and maximum stress, which could result in accelerated fatigue, highlighting the need for hydrostructural responses in design optimization. The results demonstrate that the developed methodology is useful for designing next-generation complex hydrodynamic lifting surfaces.}

    abstract    = {Aerodynamic shape optimization must consider multiple flight conditions to obtain designs that perform well in a range of situations. However, multipoint studies have relied on heuristic choices for the flight conditions and associated weights. To eliminate the heuristics, we propose a new approach where the conditions and weights are based on actual flight data. The proposed approach minimizes the expected drag value given by a probability density function in the space of the flight conditions, which can be estimated based on data from aircraft operations. To demonstrate our approach, we perform drag minimizations of the Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group Common Research Model wing, for both single-point and multipoint cases. The multipoint cases include five- and nine-point formulations, some of which approximate the expected drag value over the specified flight-condition probability distribution. We conclude that if we focus on the resulting design,
                  a five-point optimization with points based on the flight-condition distribution and equal weights is sufficient to obtain an optimal shape with respect to the expected drag value. However, if it is important to retain the accuracy of the expected drag integration at each optimization iteration, we recommend the proposed approach.}

In the first method, minimizing the total number of plies is the objective function at the global level and shuffling the stack of all the layers to satisfy manufacturing constraints is optimized at the local level. The second method introduced in this paper is to use lamination parameters related with out-of-plane stiffness matrix and numbers of ply angle (90, 0, 45/-45) as design variables with considerations of buckling and strength constraints in the top level optimization. Given lamination parameters from top level optimization as objective function for the local level, optimal stacking sequence will be determined to satisfy industrial manufacturing requirements. The results of a three-part wing box example using these two approaches are compared to results
                  from published papers to demonstrate their potencies.}

In this work, we focus on the design and optimization of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications on such HPC platforms. In order to fully utilize the computational power of such heterogeneous platforms, we propose to design the performance-critical part of CFD applications, namely the linear equation solvers, in a hybrid way. A hybrid linear solver includes both one CPU version and one GPU version of code for solving a linear equations system. When a hybrid linear equation solver is invoked during the CFD simulation, the CPU portion and the GPU portion will be run on corresponding processing devices respectively in parallel according to the execution configuration. Furthermore, we propose to build functional performance models (FPMs) of processing devices and use FPM-based
                  heterogeneous decomposition method to distribute workload between heterogeneous processing devices, in order to ensure balanced workload and optimized communication overhead. Efficiency of this approach is demonstrated by experiments with numerical simulation of lid-driven cavity flow on both a hybrid server and a hybrid cluster.}

    abstract    = {Recent metamodel-based global optimization algorithms are very promising for box-constrained expensive optimization problems. However, few of them can tackle constrained optimization problems. This article presents an improved constrained optimization algorithm, called eDIRECT-C, for expensive constrained optimization problems. In the eDIRECT-C algorithm, we present a novel DIRECT-type constraint-handling technique that separately handles feasible and infeasible cells. This technique has no user-defined parameter and is beneficial for exploring the undetected feasible regions and boundary of feasible regions. We also employ an adaptive metamodeling strategy to build appropriate metamodel types for objective and constraints respectively. This strategy yields more accurate predictions and therefore significantly speeds up the convergence. To assess the performance of eDIRECT-C, we compare it with some state-of-the-art metamodel-based constrained optimization algorithms
                  and the original DIRECT algorithm on 13 benchmark problems and 4 engineering examples. The comparative results imply that the proposed algorithm is very promising for constrained problems in terms of the convergence speed, quality of final solutions and success rate.}

    abstract    = {Metamodeling is becoming a rather popular means to approximate the expensive simulations in today's complex engineering design problems since accurate metamodels can bring in a lot of benefits. The metamodel accuracy, however, heavily depends on the locations of the observed points. Adaptive sampling, as its name suggests, places more points in regions of interest by learning the information from previous data and metamodels. Consequently, compared to traditional space-filling sampling approaches, adaptive sampling has great potential to build more accurate metamodels with fewer points (simulations), thereby gaining increasing attention and interest by both practitioners and academicians in various fields. Noticing that there is a lack of reviews on adaptive sampling for global metamodeling in the literature, which is needed, this article categorizes, reviews, and analyzes the state-of-the-art single−/multi-response adaptive sampling approaches for global
                  metamodeling in support of simulation-based engineering design. In addition, we also review and discuss some important issues that affect the success of an adaptive sampling approach as well as providing brief remarks on adaptive sampling for other purposes. Last, challenges and future research directions are provided and discussed.}

    abstract    = {DIRECT is derivative-free global-search algorithm has been found to perform robustly across a wide variety of low-dimensional test problems. The reason DIRECT's robustness is its lack of algorithmic parameters that need be ``tuned'' to make the algorithm perform well. In particular, there is no parameter that determines the relative emphasis on global versus local search. Unfortunately, the same algorithmic features that enable DIRECT to perform so robustly have a negative side effect. In particular, DIRECT is usually quick to get close to the global minimum, but very slow to refine the solution to high accuracy. This is what we call DIRECT's ``eventually inefficient behavior.'' In this paper, we outline two root causes for this undesirable behavior and propose modifications to eliminate it. The paper builds upon our previously published ``MrDIRECT'' algorithm, which we can now show only addressed the first root cause of the ``eventually inefficient behavior.'' The
                  key contribution of the current paper is a further enhancement that allows MrDIRECT to address the second root cause as well. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhanced MrDIRECT, we have identified a set of test functions that highlight different situations in which DIRECT has convergence issues. Extensive numerical work with this test suite demonstrates that the enhanced version of MrDIRECT does indeed improve the convergence rate of DIRECT.}

    abstract    = {Although DIRECT global optimization algorithm quickly gets close to the basin of the optimum, it often takes much longer to refine the solution to a high degree of accuracy. This behavior of DIRECT is similar to the ``smooth mode phenomenon'' encountered when solving linear systems discretized from partial differential equation (PDE). In the case of PDE, this smooth mode phenomenon can be eliminated efficiently by the multigrid algorithm in which the PDE solver is applied at different levels of discretization. In this paper we adapt the multigrid approach to a robust version of DIRECT algorithm, obtaining a ``multilevel'' robust DIRECT (MrDIRECT) algorithm. Although additional parameters are needed, our numerical results show that MrDIRECT is insensitive to the parameters, and the parameters setting proposed in this paper performs very well on the tested sets of benchmark problems, in terms of the speed with which the global optimum is found to a high degree of
                  accuracy.}

We draw our inspiration from the well-known DIRECT algorithm which, by exploiting the objective function behavior, produces a set of points that tries to cover the most interesting regions of the feasible set. Unfortunately, it is well-known that this strategy suffers when the dimension of the problem increases. As a first step we define a multi-start algorithm using DIRECT as a deterministic generator of starting points. Then, the new algorithm consists in repeatedly applying the previous multi-start algorithm on suitable modifications of the variable space that exploit the information gained during the optimization process. The efficiency of the new algorithm is pointed out by a consistent numerical experimentation involving both standard test problems and the optimization of Morse potential of molecular clusters.}

For the solution of such problems the DIRECT algorithm has been proposed which has a good ability to locate promising regions of the feasible domain and convergence properties based on the generation of a dense set of points over the feasible domain. However, the efficiency of DIRECT deteriorates as the dimension and the ill-conditioning of the objective function increase. To overcome these limits, we propose DIRECT-type algorithms enriched by the efficient use of derivative-free local searches combined with nonlinear transformations of the feasible domain and, possibly, of the objective function. We report extensive numerical results both on test problems from the literature and on an application in structural proteomics.}

We have compared DIRECT with standard exhaustive search and a genetic algorithm previously used for QTL mapping in two dimensions. In all two- and three-QTL test cases, DIRECT accurately finds the global optimum two to four orders of magnitude faster than when using an exhaustive search, and one order of magnitude faster than when using the genetic algorithm. Thus, randomization testing for determining empirical significance thresholds for at least three QTL is made feasible by the use of DIRECT.Availability: The code of the prototype implementation is available at

    abstract    = {A p-multigrid (p = polynomial degree) discontinuous Galerkin method is presented for the solution of the compressible Euler equations on unstructured grids. The method operates on a sequence of solution approximations of different polynomial orders. A distinct feature of this p-multigrid method is to use different time integration schemes on different approximation levels, resulting in an accurate, fast, and low memory method that can be used to accelerate the convergence of the Euler equations to a steady state for discontinuous Galerkin methods. The developed method is used to compute the compressible flows for a variety of test problems on unstructured grids. The numerical results obtained strongly indicate the order independent property of this p-multigrid method. An overall speed-up factor more than one order of magnitude for both second- and third-order solutions of all test cases in comparison with the explicit method is demonstrated.}

In this paper, we quantify the aerodynamic performance benefits of a morphing trailing using aerodynamic design optimization. The aerodynamic model solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations with a Spalart--Allmaras turbulence model. A gradient-based optimization algorithm is used in conjunction with an adjoint method that computes the required derivatives. The baseline geometry is optimized using a multipoint formulation with 192 shape design variables. The drag coefficient is minimized subject to lift, pitching moment, geometric constraints, and a 2.5g maneuver bending moment constraint. The trailing edge of the wing is optimized based on the multipoint optimized wing. The trailing edge morphing is parameterized using 90 design variables that are optimized independently for each flight condition. A total of 407 trailing edge optimizations are
                  performed with different flight conditions to span the entire flight envelope. We observed 1\% drag reduction at on-design conditions, and 5\% drag reduction near off-design conditions. The effectiveness of the trailing edge morphing is demonstrated by comparing with the optimized results of a hypothetical fully morphing wing. In addition, we compute the fuel burn reductions for a number of flights using the optimization results. A 1\% cruise fuel burn reduction is achieved using adaptive morphing trailing edge for a typical long-haul twin-aisle mission.</p>}

    abstract    = {Despite considerable research on aerodynamic shape optimization, there is no standard benchmark problem allowing researchers to compare results. This work addresses this issue by solving a series of aerodynamic shape optimization problems based on the Common Research Model wing benchmark case defined by the Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group. The aerodynamic model solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations with a Spalart--Allmaras turbulence model. A gradient-based optimization algorithm is used in conjunction with an adjoint method that computes the required derivatives. The drag coefficient is minimized subject to lift, pitching moment, and geometric constraints. A multilevel technique is used to reduce the computational cost of the optimization. A single-point optimization is solved with 720 shape variables using a 28.8-million-cell mesh, reducing the drag by 8.5\%. A more realistic design is achieved through a multipoint optimization.
                  Multiple local minima are found when starting from multiple randomly generated geometries, but the minimum drag values are within 0.1 drag counts of each other, and the geometries differ by only 0.4\% of the mean aerodynamic chord. The effect of varying the number of shape design variables is examined. The Common Research Model wing benchmark problem proved to be useful for evaluating our design optimization framework, and the geometries and meshes for both the baseline and optimized wings are available as supplemental materials in this paper.

The reasons are related to the continuous advances in technology, especially the advent of fast mi- croprocessors, which support intelligent autonomous control of several systems. Photography, construction, and monitoring and surveillance are only some of the areas in which the use of drones is becoming common. Among these, last-mile delivery is one of the most promising areas. In this work we focus on routing problems with drones, mostly in the context of parcel delivery. We survey and classify the existing works and we provide perspectives for future research.}

    abstract    = {The D8 ``double-bubble'' is a new transport aircraft configuration proposed by MIT that has the potential to provide large improvements in fuel efficiency. It has been studied at the conceptual level and in low-speed wind tunnel tests, but there was, up to now, no higher fidelity transonic design. In this study, we use the conceptual design definition as a starting point and develop a high-fidelity aerostructural optimization problem for the D8 configuration using the MACH framework. Via gradient-based optimization techniques with coupled RANS and shell FEA, the D8 is optimized at three different cruise Mach numbers (0.72, 0.78, 0.84). The preliminary results presented confirm that the planforms designed with the conceptual level tools perform well and as predicted, and that some small improvements can be gained from further optimization. In spite of its limitations, this work confirms the viability of the D8 wing-body in the transonic regime and provides preliminary
                  transonic geometries for future work.}

    abstract    = {Computational fluid dynamics through the solution of the Navier--Stokes equations with turbulence models has become commonplace. However, simply solving these equations is not sufficient to be able to perform efficient design optimization with a flow solver in the loop. This paper discusses the recommendations for developing a flow solver that is suitable for efficient aerodynamic and multidisciplinary design optimization. One of the major recommendations is to be able to load the flow solver as a library that provides direct memory access to the relevant data. Other recommendations are to use a higher-level language for scripting and to pay special attention to solution warm starting, code efficiency, flow solver robustness, and solution failure handling. As an example of a flow solver that follows these recommendations, the open-source flow solver ADflow is presented. Results from aerodynamic optimization, aerostructural analysis, and aerostructural optimization
                  using ADflow demonstrate the performance advantages claimed in the recommendations. The publication of these recommendations and the availability of the source code open the door for other solvers to adopt the same application programming interface. ADflow is part of a wider aerodynamic shape optimization tool suite that is also available under an open-source license.

    abstract    = {The phrase ``system-of-systems'' describes a large system of multiple systems, each capable of independent operation, which have been brought together to provide capabilities beyond those of each individual constituent system. Formulating and solving a system-of-systems design problem has become increasingly important in the aerospace and defense industries as customers have begun to ask contractors for broad capabilities and solutions rather than for specific individual systems. Part of a system-of-systems design problem is determining the appropriate mix of both existing and yet-to-be-designed systems. Whereas determining an appropriate mix of existing systems falls into the category of resource allocation, including features of a yet-to-be-designed system complicates the problem by requiring the allocation of a variable resource. In this paper, an airline wishing to investigate how a new, yet-to-be-designed aircraft will impact the fleet operating costs provides a
                  simple example of this type of problem. The resulting statement is a mixed-integer, nonlinear programming problem. Both a traditional approach and a new decomposition approach were used to solve the problem. The traditional approach is a mixed- integer nonlinear branch-and-bound. The decomposition approach applied to the problem is analogous to those of multidisciplinary optimization, in which there is an allocation domain and an aircraft sizing domain. When the problem size increases to the point where the traditional mixed-integer, nonlinear programming approaches cannot obtain a solution, the decomposition approach can find solutions for these larger problems. The multidisciplinary design optimization-motivated decomposition approach appears to have promise for the allocation of variable resources challenge presented by many system-of-systems design problems.}

    abstract    = {The second-generation of supersonic civil transport has to match ambitious targets in terms of efficiency to be economically and environmentally viable. CFD-based design optimization offers a powerful approach to address the complex tradeoffs intrinsic to this novel configuration. We apply this approach to the design of airfoils and wings at both supersonic cruise conditions and lower-speed, off-design conditions. We perform single and multipoint optimization to minimize the drag over an ideal supersonic aircraft flight envelope and assess the influence of physical and numerical parameters on optimization accuracy and robustness. To obtain more favorable design tradeoffs between different flight regimes, we introduce morphing leading and trailing edge capabilities, and quantify their benefits against fixed-wing shapes. The optimized layouts outperform baseline supersonic reference designs over a range of flight conditions, with drag reductions from 4\% up to 86\% for
                  airfoils, and between 24\% and 74\% reductions relative to a reference wing. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach enables the fast and effective design of highly-efficient wings, capturing non-intuitive tradeoffs, and offering more in-depth physical insight into the optimal layouts.}

    abstract    = {The decarbonization of the electric grid is a fundamental technological and socio-economical challenge to address the looming threat of climate change. The reduction of the levelized cost of energy is a critical step to expand the application of carbon-free technologies that rely on high-potential, renewable energy sources such as wind power. Advanced computational tools are instrumental to capturing the tightly-coupled, multi-physics interactions that characterize modern highly-flexible wind turbine rotors. In this work, we use our high-fidelity multidisciplinary design optimization software to perform aerostructural optimization studies of a large wind turbine configuration, using an efficient, highly-scalable, gradient-based approach on a coupled CFD/FEM model. We investigate the trade-offs between steady-state aerodynamic efficiency and structural cost of a benchmark rotor using more than 100 structural and geometric design variables. Mass and torque are
                  simultaneously used as performance metrics as we constrain the maximum stress and tip displacement of the rotor at below-rated operating conditions. We discuss both the optimized design features and the general design trends in the form of Pareto front analyses as we sweep over different prescribed torque values and objective weights. The results highlight the benefits of the coupled model with respect to a single-discipline strategy and showcase the additional insight that high-fidelity analysis tools offer to designers. As we work towards a more refined structural model and the inclusion of a larger set of shape variables to extend the optimization capabilities of the tool, the results support the idea that such high-fidelity approaches can complement conventional low-fidelity tools in the design of light and efficient turbine blades.}

    abstract    = {The mitigation of climate change effects through the decarbonization of the global production system is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. Wind and solar power will account for tenths of petawatt-hour yearly by the second half of this century. Thus, efficient energy harvesting systems need to be rapidly developed to match the demand for low-cost-per-kilowatt electricity from renewable sources. Wind energy technology has matured prominently in the last few decades. However, the growing size and complexity of modern wind turbines is pushing the boundaries of conventional design tools and methodologies. Large and highly flexible rotors are characterized by complex multiphysics interactions and unconventional design features that require novel investigation strategies. High-fidelity design tools promise to address these arising challenges. Their application however has been limited by their computational and implementation costs so far. The outcome of my
                  doctoral work is the first set of large-scale high-fidelity wind turbine rotor aerostructural design optimization studies. I use a framework that couples computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational structural mechanics (CSM) analyses with an efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm. The coupled-adjoint sensitivity solver implementation makes the problem numerically tractable and highly scalable. The optimization studies I perform account for multiple representative steady-state below-rated operating conditions and use hundreds of structural and geometric design variables simultaneously. First, I adapt an existing aircraft design framework to handle a wind turbine rotor and its system sensitivities. Both the aerodynamic solver and geometry manipulation tool are enhanced, and a newly developed aerostructural rotor model is verified. Following that, I demonstrate the framework optimization capabilities on this benchmark rotor model. I dissect optimal
                  design features and explore tradeoffs between steady-state aerodynamic efficiency and structural weight, quantifying the impact of design freedom and objective formulation on the final design. A more refined aerostructural model is then used to perform composite fiber angle tailoring. The optimizer leverages material anisotropic properties to increase local stiffness and reduce the sandwich panel thickness. The resulting designs are more than 10\% lighter than the benchmark for the same planform shape. Next, I optimize the rotor for multiple wind and rotation velocities. Single-point designs are outperformed over a larger operational envelope and flow separation at off-design conditions is mitigated. Enabling modifications to airfoil geometry leads to radical rotor redesign. Using the full set of geometrical and structural variables leads to an aeroelastically tailored rotor with more than 10\% higher average torque and a 40\% lighter structure than the baseline
                  model. Finally, I collaborated to the development of a mixed-fidelity framework combining our high-fidelity code with conventional design tools. This prototype software enables high-fidelity optimization including life-cycle sizing constraints. We use state-of-the-art software to predict extreme loads and fatigue damage from time-accurate multiphysics simulations. Two different approaches are proposed to integrate these constraints within our original framework. Modelling the full range of operating conditions and improving the tradeoffs between accuracy and cost remain open challenges. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates how coupled CFD-CSM approaches can capture unconventional design tradeoffs and provide an unprecedented level of insight on the optimal blade design features. High-fidelity optimization can complement conventional design approaches using more realistic blade-resolved rotor models and leveraging a larger design space. The results I present pave the
                  way for more comprehensive design studies and holistic multifidelity design optimization workflows.}

The study is formalized as a Bayesian optimization problem, or continuous multi-armed bandit problem, where a batch of {\$}{\$}q > 0{\$}{\$}arms is pulled in parallel at each iteration. Several algorithms have been developed for choosing batches by trading off exploitation and exploration. As of today, the maximum Expected Improvement (EI) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) selection rules appear as the most prominent approaches for batch selection. Here, we build upon recent work on the multipoint Expected Improvement criterion, for which an analytic expansion relying on Tallis' formula was recently established. The computational burden of this selection rule being still an issue in application, we derive a closed-form expression for the gradient of the multipoint Expected Improvement, which aims at facilitating its maximization
                  using gradient-based ascent algorithms. Substantial computational savings are shown in application. In addition, our algorithms are tested numerically and compared to state-of-the-art UCB-based batch-sequential algorithms. Combining starting designs relying on UCB with gradient-based EI local optimization finally appears as a sound option for batch design in distributed Gaussian Process optimization.}

    abstract    = {A new integrated aero-structural design method for aerospace vehicles is presented. The approach combines an aero-structural analysis solver, a coupled aero-structural adjoint solver, a geometry engine, and an efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm. The aero-structural solver ensures accurate solutions by using high-fidelity models for the aerodynamics, structures, and coupling procedure. The coupled aero-structural adjoint solver is used to calculate the sensitivities of aerodynamic and structural cost functions with respect to both aerodynamic shape and structural variables. The aero-structural adjoint sensitivities are compared with those given by the complex-step derivative approximation and finite differences. The proposed method is shown to be both accurate and efficient, exhibiting a significant cost advantage when the gradient of a small number of functions with respect to a large number of design variables is needed. The optimization of a supersonic
                  business jet configuration demonstrates the usefulness and importance of computing aero-structural sensitivities using the coupled-adjoint method.}

Improvements to the basic method are suggested that further increase its accuracy and robustness and unveil the connection to algorithmic differentiation theory. A general procedure for the implementation of the complex-step method is described in detail and a script is developed that automates its implementation. Automatic implementations of the complex-step method for Fortran and C/C++ are presented and compared to existing algorithmic differentiation tools. The complex-step method is tested in two large multidisciplinary solvers and the resulting sensitivities are compared to results given by finite differences. The resulting sensitivities are shown to be as accurate as the analyses. Accuracy, robustness, ease of implementation and maintainability make these complex-step derivative approximation tools very attractive options for sensitivity analysis.}

    abstract    = {Changing the shape of aircraft is beneficial because they operate in a wide range of flight conditions with conflicting requirements and the concomitant variations in aircraft performance. This chapter focuses on morphing systems that contribute to reducing fuel burn for commercial transport aircraft. We start with a summary of how morphing can reduce fuel burn from the system-level viewpoint, following which we analyze the three wing-morphing modes: planform, out of plane, and airfoil. For each of these, we review morphing mechanisms that are already in place, such as high-lift systems, and provide an outlook on how more advanced morphing technologies can further reduce fuel burn. The impact of any morphing system must be quantified by considering all the disciplines involved, and a clean-sheet design should be done to realize the full potential. The most promising type of morphing for the near future is variable trailing-edge camber, which can tailor the
                  aerodynamic performance and more effectively alleviate maneuver load. Research on new materials and morphing mechanisms will make morphing systems lighter, more energy efficient, and more economical. It is just a question of time before we see aircraft wings that exhibit morphing capabilities that seem impossible today.}

We review our recent developments for each of these components, and present open-source tools made available for aerodynamic shape optimization. A variety of applications is presented, including the optimization of a supercritical airfoil starting from a circle, a web application that optimizes airfoils within a few seconds, aircraft aerodynamic and aerostructural optimization, and aeropropulsive optimization. We also review our experience with solving the Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group (ADODG) benchmarks and other problems in aerodynamic shape optimization. Among the ADODG benchmarks, we focus on the RANS-based problems and discuss some of the issues encountered, including the comparison between Euler and RANS results, and design space multimodality.

For each of these topics, we describe Haftka's contributions, how they impacted our research, and examples of what they enabled us to do. The overarching theme of the contributions and developments described in this paper is the efficient computation of derivatives, which, together with gradient-based optimizers, enables the optimization with respect to large numbers of design variables, even when using costly high-fidelity models.}

                  Based on course-tested material, this rigorous yet accessible graduate textbook covers both fundamental and advanced optimization theory and algorithms. It covers a wide range of numerical methods and topics, including both gradient-based and gradient-free algorithms, multidisciplinary design optimization, and uncertainty, with instruction on how to determine which algorithm should be used for a given application. It also provides an overview of models and how to prepare them for use with numerical optimization, including derivative computation. Over 400 high-quality visualizations and numerous examples facilitate understanding of the theory, and practical tips address common issues encountered in practical engineering design optimization and how to address them. Numerous end-of-chapter homework problems, progressing in difficulty, help put knowledge into practice. Accompanied online by a solutions manual for instructors and source code for problems, this is ideal for
                  a one- or two-semester graduate course on optimization in aerospace, civil, mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineering departments.

In addition to developing the fundamental theory, Jameson implemented that theory in codes that were practical enough to be used in industry.

This research area has experienced sustained improvements in CFD solvers, mesh deformation, sensitivity computation, and optimization tools.

    abstract    = { A comprehensive review of aerofoil shape parameterization methods that can be used for aerodynamic shape optimization is presented. Seven parameterization methods are considered for a range of design variables: class--shape transformations; B-splines; Hicks--Henne bump functions; a radial basis function domain element approach; B{\`e}zier surfaces; a singular-value decomposition modal extraction method; and the parameterized sections method. Because of the large range of variables involved, the most effective way to implement each method is first investigated. Their performances are then analyzed by considering the geometric shape recovery of over 2000 aerofoils using a range of design variables, testing the efficiency of design space coverage with respect to a given tolerance. It is shown that, for all the methods, between 20 and 25 design variables are needed to cover the full design space to within a geometric tolerance, with the singular-value decomposition
                  method doing this most efficiently. A set of transonic aerofoil case studies are also presented, with geometric error and convergence of the resulting aerodynamic properties explored. These results show a strong relationship between geometric error and aerodynamic convergence and demonstrate that between 38 and 66 design variables may be needed to ensure aerodynamic convergence to within one drag and one lift count. }

    abstract    = {In this paper, the accuracy and practical capabilities of three different reduced-order models (ROMs) are explored: an enhanced implicit condensation and expansion (EnICE) model, a finite element beam model, and a finite volume beam model are compared for their capability to accurately predict the nonlinear structural response of geometrically nonlinear built-up wing structures. This work briefly outlines the different order reduction methods, highlighting the associated assumptions and computational effort. The ROMs are then used to calculate the wing deflection for different representative load cases and these results are compared with the global finite element model (GFEM) predictions when possible. Overall, the ROMs are found to be able to capture the nonlinear GFEM behaviour accurately, but differences are noticed at very large displacements and rotations due to local geometrical effects.}

    abstract    = {A model for the prediction of laminar-turbulent transition processes was formulated. It is based on the LCTM (`Local Correlation-based Transition Modelling') concept, where experimental correlations are being integrated into standard convection-diffusion transport equations using local variables. The starting point for the model was the $\gamma$-Re$\theta$model already widely used in aerodynamics and turbomachinery CFD applications. Some of the deficiencies of the $\gamma$-Re$\theta$model, like the lack of Galilean invariance were removed. Furthermore, the Re$\theta$equation was avoided and the correlations for transition onset prediction have been significantly simplified. The model has been calibrated against a wide range of Falkner-Skan flows and has been applied to a variety of test cases.}

However, they have not produced a significant breakthrough in the area of nonlinear programming due to the fact that they have not addressed the issue of constraints in a systematic way. Only recently have several methods been proposed for handling nonlinear constraints by evolutionary algorithms for numerical optimization problems; however, these methods have several drawbacks, and the experimental results on many test cases have been disappointing. In this paper we (1) discuss difficulties connected with solving the general nonlinear programming problem; (2) survey several approaches that have emerged in the evolutionary computation community; and (3) provide a set of 11 interesting test cases that may serve as a handy reference for future methods. }

    abstract    = {High-speed propulsor blades often experience moderate to substantial amounts of unsteady cavitation, and up to now have been designed via design methods for noncavitating blades combined with methods for the analysis of cavitating flows in a trial-and-error manner. In this paper, a numerical nonlinear optimization algorithm is developed for the automated, systematic design of cavitating blades. The method is first applied to the design of propeller blades in uniform flow. The blade mean camber surface is defined via a cubic B-spline polygon net in order to facilitate the handling of the geometry, and to reduce the number of the design parameters. Noncavitating blade geometries designed by the present method are directly compared with those designed via an existing lifting-line/lifting-surface design approach. Finally, the optimization algorithm is applied to the design of cavitating blades in nonuniform flow. The objective of the design is to obtain maximum propeller
                  efficiency for given conditions by allowing controlled amounts of sheet cavitation. Several constraints on the unsteady cavity characteristics, such as the area of cavity planform and the amplitudes of the cavity volume velocity harmonics, are incorporated in the optimization technique. The effect of the constraints on the efficiency of the propeller design is demonstrated with various test cases.}

    abstract    = {A well-known example of global optimization that provides solutions within fixed error limits is optimization of functions with a known Lipschitz constant. In many real-life problems this constant is unknown. To address that, we propose a novel method called Pareto-Lipschitzian Optimization (PLO) that provides solutions within fixed error limits for functions with unknown Lipschitz constants. In the proposed approach, a set of all unknown Lipschitz constants is regarded as multiple criteria using the concept of Pareto Optimality (PO). We compare PLO to the existing algorithm DIRECT. We show that, in contrast to PLO, the DIRECT algorithm considers only a subset of PO decisions that are selected by a heuristic rule depending on an adjustable parameter. It means that some PO decisions are preferred to others. By contrast, PLO regards all PO decisions without preferences and is naturally suited to utilize highly parallel computing.

Partition patterns of the PLOR algorithm are similar to those of DIviding RECTangles (DIRECT), which was widely applied to different real-life problems. However here a set of all Lipschitz constants is reduced to just two: the maximal and the minimal ones. In such a way the PLOR approach is independent of any user-defined parameters and balances equally local and global search during the optimization process. An expanded list of other well-known DIRECT-type algorithms is used in investigation and experimental comparison using the standard test problems and truss optimization problems. The experimental investigation shows that the PLOR algorithm gives very competitive results to other DIRECT-type algorithms using standard test problems and performs pretty well
                  on real truss optimization problems.}

This problem is stated as a nonlinear programming (NLP)problem subject to nonlinear differential-algebraic constraints. These problems are known to be frequently ill-conditioned and multimodal. Thus, traditional (gradient-based)local optimization methods fail to arrive at satisfactory solutions. To surmount this limitation, the use of several state-of-the-art deterministic and stochastic global optimization methods is explored. A case study considering the estimation of 36 parameters of a nonlinear biochemical dynamic model is taken as a benchmark. Only a certain type of stochastic algorithm, evolution strategies (ES), is able to solve this problem successfully. Although these stochastic methods cannot guarantee global optimality with certainty, their robustness, plus the fact that in inverse problems they have a known lower bound for the cost function,
                  make them the best available candidates.}

The approach described in this article starts from a requirement formulation based on a time-series of spanwise lift distributions on a morphing wing, representing the mission profile of the aircraft as a whole. This allows to specify goals based directly on aerodynamic performances instead of prescribing fixed geometrical shapes. Using the aero-structural analysis tool presented here, together with a parametrization representing the airfoil outer shape as well as its mechanical properties, allows the formulation of a combined aero-structural optimization problem. Promising aerodynamic and structural morphing performances have been obtained by applying the method to a morphing concept using Dielectric Elastomers (DEs) as actuators. Although the coupled physics are considered and a
                  detailed material model has been used, results can be obtained within reasonable computational time by parallel evaluation of the candidate solutions. Improved aerodynamic performances have been obtained using this concurrent coupled method, in comparison to a sequential aerodynamic and structural optimization.}

    abstract    = {This paper presents the design, optimization, realization and testing of a novel wing morphing concept, based on distributed compliance structures, and actuated by piezoelectric elements. The adaptive wing features ribs with a selectively compliant inner structure, numerically optimized to achieve aerodynamically efficient shape changes while simultaneously withstanding aeroelastic loads. The static and dynamic aeroelastic behavior of the wing, and the effect of activating the actuators, is assessed by means of coupled 3D aerodynamic and structural simulations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed morphing concept and optimization procedure, the wings of a model airplane are designed and manufactured according to the presented approach. The goal is to replace conventional ailerons, thus to achieve controllability in roll purely by morphing. The mechanical properties of the manufactured components are characterized experimentally, and used to create a
                  refined and correlated finite element model. The overall stiffness, strength, and actuation capabilities are experimentally tested and successfully compared with the numerical prediction. To counteract the nonlinear hysteretic behavior of the piezoelectric actuators, a closed-loop controller is implemented, and its capability of accurately achieving the desired shape adaptation is evaluated experimentally. Using the correlated finite element model, the aeroelastic behavior of the manufactured wing is simulated, showing that the morphing concept can provide sufficient roll authority to allow controllability of the flight. The additional degrees of freedom offered by morphing can be also used to vary the plane lift coefficient, similarly to conventional flaps. The efficiency improvements offered by this technique are evaluated numerically, and compared to the performance of a rigid wing.}

    abstract    = {The use of maneuver load alleviation (MLA) in an aircraft can lead to significant performance gains through a decrease in the aircraft's structural weight and synergies with the aerodynamic design. This paper presents a control agnostic approach for incorporating MLA in the multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO), based on expanding the design space with the addition of control surface deflections during a maneuver as design variables. In order to avoid adding design variables to the overall aircraft optimization problem, a bi-level optimization architecture is employed. The inner problem consists of minimizing the aggregated stresses during a maneuver, which are computed in a beam-based structural model coupled with aerodynamics based on the method of sections. The outer optimization problem is an aircraft range maximization MDO, evaluated on a shell-based structure model coupled with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes aerodynamics. This problem is solved for a
                  clamped wing model, with and without a geometrically non-linear flutter constraint. The inclusion of the flutter constraint is shown to impact the trends in the optimal design.}

We develop a simplified and generalized formulation of contact-invariant optimization that enables continuous optimization over contact timings. This formulation is applied to a fully physical humanoid model whose lower limbs are actuated by musculotendon units. Our approach does not rely on prior motion data or on task-specific controllers. Motion is synthesized from first principles, given only a detailed physical model of the body and spacetime constraints. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of activities, such as walking, running, jumping, and kicking. Our approach produces walking motions that quantitatively match ground-truth data, and predicts aspects of human gait initiation, incline walking, and locomotion in reduced gravity.}

The results show that added mass significantly reduces the natural frequencies of cantilevered marine structures as a function of relative submergence depth, more so for composite plates than for steel plates because of the much lower ratio of effective structural mass to hydrodynamic added mass. Added mass effects are most dramatic for partially submerged plates as the plates move from being above to completely beneath the free surface. Free surface effects are shown to become negligible for a fully submerged plate parallel to the free surface when the depth of submergence exceeds 50\% of the plate length. Solid boundaries are found to have limited effects for fully-submerged plates near a wall, where maximum decreases in resonance frequencies due to
                  increases in added mass are only a few percent.}

    abstract    = {Kriging models have been widely used in computer experiments for the analysis of time-consuming computer codes. Based on kernels, they are flexible and can be tuned to many situations. In this paper, we construct kernels that reproduce the computer code complexity by mimicking its interaction structure. While the standard tensor-product kernel implicitly assumes that all interactions are active, the new kernels are suited for a general interaction structure, and will take advantage of the absence of interaction between some inputs. The methodology is twofold. First, the interaction structure is estimated from the data, using a first initial standard Kriging model, and represented by a so-called FANOVA graph. New FANOVA-based sensitivity indices are introduced to detect active interactions. Then this graph is used to derive the form of the kernel, and the corresponding Kriging model is estimated by maximum likelihood. The performance of the overall procedure is
                  illustrated by several 3-dimensional and 6-dimensional simulated and real examples. A substantial improvement is observed when the computer code has a relatively high level of complexity.}

Fastest convergence (quadratic for the first-order ``backward Euler'' scheme) is obtained with the upwind switching provided by van Leer's differentiable split fluxes, which easily linearize in time. With Roe's nondifferentiable split flux-differences the iterations may get trapped in a limit-cycle. This also happens in a second-order scheme with split fluxes, if the matrix coefficients arising in the implicit time-linearization are not properly centered in space. The use of second-order terms computed from split fluxes degrades the accuracy of the solution, especially if these are subjected to a limiter for the sake of monotonicity preservation. Second-order terms computed from the characteristic variables perform best.}

Moreover, such meshes can lead to poor accuracy in the approximate solution computed. In this paper, we present a nonlinear fractional program that relocates the vertex coordinates of a given mesh to optimize the average element shape quality as measured by the inverse mean-ratio metric. To solve the resulting large-scale optimization problems, we apply an efficient implementation of an inexact Newton algorithm that uses the conjugate gradient method with a block Jacobi preconditioner to compute the direction. We show that the block Jacobi preconditioner is positive definite by proving a general theorem concerning the convexity of fractional functions, applying this result to components of the inverse mean-ratio metric, and showing that
                  each block in the preconditioner is invertible. Numerical results obtained with this special-purpose code on several test meshes are presented and used to quantify the impact on solution time and memory requirements of using a modeling language and general-purpose algorithm to solve these problems.}

Deploying UAVs from the truck enables customers located further from the depot to receive drone-based deliveries. The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). However, owing to the computational complexity of this problem, only trivially-sized problems may be solved directly via the MILP. Thus, a heuristic solution approach that consists of solving a sequence of three subproblems is proposed. Extensive numerical testing demonstrates that this approach effectively solves problems of practical size within reasonable runtimes. Additional analysis quantifies the potential time savings associated with employing multiple UAVs. The analysis also reveals that additional UAVs may have diminishing marginal returns. An analysis of five different endurance models demonstrates the effects of
                  these models on UAV assignments. The model and heuristic also support anticipated future systems that feature automation for UAV launch and retrieval.}

The analysis features a generic commercial wind farm consisting of 100 five megawatt turbines, at a far offshore site in a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) perspective. Data for existing bottom-fixed turbines, both jacket and monopile concepts are used as reference values for adaptation to the generic wind farm parameters. The results indicate that LCOE values are strongly dependent on depth and distance from shore, due to mooring costs and export cable length, respectively. Based on the findings, depth is the dominant parameter to determine the optimal concept for a site. Distance to shore, Load Factor and availability are amongst the significant factors affecting the LCOE. The
                  findings also indicate that LCOE of floating turbines applied in large scale and in intermediate depths of 50-150 m is comparable to bottom-fixed turbines. Floating turbines for increasing depths generally experience increased LCOE at a lower rate than bottom-fixed turbines. An optimal site, situated 100 km offshore would give LCOE in the range of € 82.0-€ 236.7 per megawatt-hour for the conceptual designs in this paper.}

    abstract    = {Optimization for process design in the chemical engineering industry has been important for energy efficiency and economic feasibility. Because many industries perform optimization with a commercial process simulator such as the Aspen HYSYS, an optimization methodology for expensive black-box functions is needed. Thus, the development of derivative free optimization algorithms has long been studied and the deterministic global search algorithm DIRECT (DIviding a hyper-RECTangle) was suggested. In this paper, a modified DIRECT algorithm with a sub-dividing step for considering hidden constraints is proposed. The effectiveness of the algorithm is exemplified by its application to a cryogenic mixed refrigerant process using a single mixed refrigerant for natural gas liquefaction and its comparison with a well-known stochastic algorithm (GA, PSO, SA), and model based search algorithm (SNOBFIT), local solver (GPS, GSS, MADS, active-set, interior-point, SQP), and other
                  hidden constraint handling methods, including the barrier approach and the neighborhood assignment strategy. Optimal solution calculated by the proposed algorithms decreases the specific power required for natural gas liquefaction to 18.9\% compared to the base case.}

    abstract    = {The goal of this paper is to investigate and develop a fast and robust algorithm for the solution of high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of non-linear systems of conservation laws on unstructured grids. Herein we present the development of a spectral hp-multigrid method, where the coarse ``grid'' levels are constructed by reducing the order (p) of approximation of the discretization using hierarchical basis functions (p-multigrid), together with the traditional (h-multigrid) approach of constructing coarser grids with fewer elements. On each level we employ variants of the element-Jacobi scheme, where the Jacobian entries associated with each element are treated implicitly (i.e., inverted directly) and all other entries are treated explicitly. The methodology is developed for the two-dimensional non-linear Euler equations on unstructured grids, using both non-linear (FAS) and linear (CGC) multigrid schemes. Results are presented for the channel
                  flow over a bump and a uniform flow over a four element airfoil. Current results demonstrate convergence rates which are independent of both order of accuracy (p) of the discretization and level of mesh resolution (h).}

    abstract    = {Imperfectly scaled models are commonplace in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics because few facilities can meet all the flow and structural scaling requirements. The objectives of this work are to (1) derive and numerically validate scaling relations for the steady-state and dynamic hydroelastic response and stability of hydrodynamic composite lifting surfaces and (2) to investigate the effect of imperfect scaling on the steady-state and dynamic response, as well as hydroelastic stability of said surfaces. We derive proper scaling laws and validate them through numerical simulations using unsteady potential flow and composite beam theory. We investigate the prediction of inception of a new, low-frequency mode that only develops at sufficiently high speeds using scaled models. We demonstrate scaling effects on the modal frequencies, damping coefficients, and hydroelastic instability boundaries by comparing cases with fully enforced scaling laws and cases with relaxed
                  similarities. Using the same material for both the prototype and reduced length-scale models results in imperfect scaling; the steady-state and dynamic hydroelastic responses are not scaled, and smaller length-scale models exhibit delayed hydroelastic instabilities. The conclusion is that using appropriate materials for model scale tests to satisfy Cauchy number similarity is necessary for similar steady-state response, but dynamic similarity additionally requires similar solid-to-fluid added mass ratio. Proper scaling allows one to accurately interpret and assess the performance and stability of full-scale flexible composite lifting surfaces such as foils, propulsors, turbines, fins, rudders, energy saving devices, and energy harvesters.}

The new approach overcomes some weaknesses of the existing methods such as the perturb and observe method as it is capable of searching for global maximum. This is particularly important for a system that is partially shaded. To validate the performance of the proposed scheme, experimental studies have been conducted. The results have shown that the proposed approach is robust and possesses a fast tracking speed.}

It has mainly been used in solving nonlinear problems, but it has so many other applications that it should perhaps be used in most advanced programs. The scheme, its programming, and several of its applications are sketched below. Another, perhaps the most important application of FAS is described in {\S}9, and yet another one in {\S}15.}

    abstract    = {AERODYNAMIC shape optimization is one of the major research$\backslash$nareas of the present computational ¯ uid dynamics$\backslash$ncommunity.1 Althoughvarioustechniqueshavebeenpresented,they$\backslash$nhave usually concentrated on how the existing optimization algorithms$\backslash$nare appliedto aerodynamicproblems.There were few papers$\backslash$nthat assessed performance of the optimization algorithms for aerodynamic$\backslash$nproblems.$\backslash$nIn this Note, three different optimization algorithms are applied$\backslash$nto airfoil design. A simpli{\textregistered} ed test problem is considered here so$\backslash$nthat the distributionof the objective function can be plotted.The visualization$\backslash$nof the objective function will reveal which optimization$\backslash$nstrategy is preferable. The results of three optimization algorithms$\backslash$nwill be easy to compare and to evaluate as to performance.$\backslash$nOne of the three algorithms
                  employed here is the gradient-based$\backslash$nmethod (GM).2 In this method, the design is updated iteratively in$\backslash$nthe direction of the steepest ascent from the initial design (the hillclimbing$\backslash$nstrategy). Many variations of GM have been used widely$\backslash$ninasmuch as the optimum obtained from GM is a global optimum$\backslash$nif the objective and constraints are differentiable and convex.2 In$\backslash$npractice, however, it is very dif{\textregistered} cult to prove these properties. One$\backslash$ncould only hope for a local optimum in the neighborhood of the$\backslash$ninitial point, provided that the gradient is well de{\textregistered} ned. Therefore,$\backslash$none must start the design from various initial points to determine$\backslash$nif a consistent optimum can be obtained while having reasonable$\backslash$nassurance that this is the true optimum.$\backslash$nThe second is the method of simulated annealing (SA).3 SA is
                  a$\backslash$nheuristic strategy for obtaining near-optimal solutions and derives$\backslash$nits name froman analogyto the annealingof solids.Basically, in this$\backslash$nmethod, the design is updated if a randomly disturbed one is better.$\backslash$nThis strategy is still hill climbing, and it could end up with local$\backslash$nextrema easily as GM does. Thus, SA also accepts a poorer design$\backslash$nwith certain probability related to the Boltzmann distributionunder$\backslash$nthe speci{\textregistered} ed annealingschedule.Therefore,there is a corresponding$\backslash$nchance for the designto get out of a local extreme in favor of {\textregistered} nding$\backslash$na better,more global one.$\backslash$nThe last of the three is genetic algorithm (GA).4 GA is a search$\backslash$nalgorithm based on the mechanics of natural selection and natural$\backslash$ngenetics.GA searches an optimumthrough simulated evolution.$\backslash$nDuring evolution, genotypes
                  (design variables) producing phenotypes$\backslash$n(designs) of increasing biological {\textregistered} tness (objective function)$\backslash$nPresented as Paper 96-2394 at the 14th AIAA Applied Aerodynamics$\backslash$nConference, New Orleans, LA, June 17$\pm$20, 1996; received Aug. 29, 1996;$\backslash$nrevision received April 14, 1997; accepted for publication April 23, 1997.$\backslash$nCopyright c $\,^{\circ}$ 1997 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics,$\backslash$nInc.

The combination of mutation and$\backslash$nrecombination, in principle, allows for leaving a smaller
                  hill and,$\backslash$ntherefore, prevents evolution from getting stuck on local extrema.$\backslash$nRecently, GA has attracted attention as a robust optimization$\backslash$ntool.5,6 However, because GA requires a large number of function$\backslash$nevaluations, one might question why GA is preferred against other$\backslash$nmethods.The aimof this Note is to answer this question and demonstrate$\backslash$nGA' s ability using a simpli{\textregistered} ed optimization problem.}

    abstract    = {We propose a robust structural optimization of a plate wing that considers the bifurcation in higher mode flutter, which affects the robustness of an optimum design and the convergence of an optimization. In the optimization, the thickness distribution of a delta wing is considered to improve the critical dynamic pressure of supersonic flutter under the constant total mass. The convergence is improved by detaching the distance of eigenvalues between adjacent modes by the positive constant value in the optimization. Consequently, the critical dynamic pressure of the optimum design is six times larger than that of the uniform design. Moreover, to improve the robustness, the constraints are proposed to keep eigenvalues between adjacent modes apart by the specified distance which is composed of the sensitivity of the distance of eigenvalues. Numerical results indicate that the robustness of the optimum design is quantitatively obtained with the constraints.}

    abstract    = {We propose a scalable framework for the learning of high-dimensional parametric maps via adaptively constructed residual network (ResNet) maps between reduced bases of the inputs and outputs. When just few training data are available, it is beneficial to have a compact parametrization in order to ameliorate the ill-posedness of the neural network training problem. By linearly restricting high-dimensional maps to informed reduced bases of the inputs, one can compress high-dimensional maps in a constructive way that can be used to detect appropriate basis ranks, equipped with rigorous error estimates. A scalable neural network learning framework is thus to learn the nonlinear compressed reduced basis mapping. Unlike the reduced basis construction, however, neural network constructions are not guaranteed to reduce errors by adding representation power, making it difficult to achieve good practical performance. Inspired by recent approximation theory that connects
                  ResNets to sequential minimizing flows, we present an adaptive ResNet construction algorithm. This algorithm allows for depth-wise enrichment of the neural network approximation, in a manner that can achieve good practical performance by first training a shallow network and then adapting. We prove universal approximation of the associated neural network class for Lν2 functions on compact sets. Our overall framework allows for constructive means to detect appropriate breadth and depth, and related compact parametrizations of neural networks, significantly reducing the need for architectural hyperparameter tuning. Numerical experiments for parametric PDE problems and a 3D CFD wing design optimization parametric map demonstrate that the proposed methodology can achieve remarkably high accuracy for limited training data, and outperformed other neural network strategies we compared against.}

The algorithm employs second-order summation-by-parts operators on multiblock structured grids with simultaneous approximation terms to enforce block interface coupling and boundary conditions. The discrete equations are solved iteratively with an inexact-Newton method, while the linear system at each Newton iteration is solved using a flexible Krylov subspace iterative method with an approximate-Schur parallel preconditioner. The algorithm is verified and validated through the solution of two-dimensional model problems, highlighting the correspondence of the current algorithm with several
                  established flow solvers. A transonic solution over the ONERA M6 wing on a mesh with 15.1 million nodes shows good agreement with experiment. Using 128 processors, the residual is reduced by 12 orders of magnitude in 86 min. The solution of transonic flow over the common research model wing--body geometry exhibits the expected grid convergence behavior. The algorithm performs well in solving flows around nonplanar geometries and flows with explicitly specified laminar-to-turbulent transition locations. Parallel scaling studies highlight the excellent scaling characteristics of the algorithm on cases with up to 6656 processors and grids with over 150 million nodes.}

    abstract    = {Urban air mobility vehicles have taken form as advanced rotorcraft with sets of wings, rotors, canards, and other appendages. Noise generation is an important technical barrier that must be addressed to prevent these vehicles from causing excessive disturbance to the communities they are intended to service. There is a need for efficient and low-fidelity analysis tools specifically for the conceptual design and sizing phase of urban air mobility vehicle development. Such tools must be computationally efficient to allow for repeated analyses needed for design optimization. This paper presents coupled aerodynamic and aeroacoustic analysis formulated for gradient-based design optimization. Rotor performance is modeled using HELIX, a hybrid blade element momentum theory tool, coupled with PULSE, an aeroacoustic analysis tool based on the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings aeroacoustic analogy, reformulated as Farassat Formulation 1A. This work presents a methodology for
                  computing implicit derivatives of the coupled aerodynamic and aeroacoustic models implemented within the software package OpenMDAO. Both models are validated independently, and derivatives are verified using finite difference and complex step approximations. These tools are used to analyze and optimize the rotors on the single passenger NASA N+1 quadrotor vehicle with respect to blade-shape parameters. This paper aims to introduce aeroacoustic analysis into gradient-based optimization efficiently and demonstrate the impact that such optimization can have for minimizing the noise footprint of an urban air mobility vehicle.}

These complex geometries introduce physical phenomena such as propeller-wing and propeller-propeller interactions. Understanding these phenomena and optimizing a vehicle design considering their effects can lead to improved efficiency throughout a vehicle's mission. This work considers the NASA urban air mobility tiltwing concept vehicle and analyzes the performance of its wing considering varying numbers of propellers. The tiltwing's wing is analyzed and subsequently optimized for zero to five propellers to understand the potential for wing design improvements. This work finds that the tiltwing vehicle in cruise flight does benefit from wing-mounted propellers, however the strongest improvement in efficiency is found with a single propeller at the wingtip, with decreasing benefit as the number of
                  propellers is increased. While this work considers only aerodynamic shape optimization without structural and packaging constraints or power plant design, it provides quantitative and qualitative insight into the advantages and disadvantages of distributed propulsors in cruise flight. Additionally, this work shows that while aerodynamic shape optimization is a useful tool for improving wing performance, considering propeller-wing interaction effects leads to a negligible improvement in optimized design.}

The model comprises the components of stress analysis, fatigue failure analysis and fatigue material property degradation. Stress analysis of the composite laminate was performed by creating a three{\^a}dimensional finite element model in the ANSYS FE code. Fatigue failure analysis was performed by using a set of Hashin{\^a}type failure criteria and the Ye{\^a}delamination criterion. Two types of material property degradations on the basis of element stiffness and strength were applied: a sudden degradation because of sudden failure detected by the fatigue failure criteria and a gradual degradation because of the nature of cyclic loading, which is driven by the increased number of cycles. The
                  gradual degradation of the composite material was modelled by using functions relating the residual stiffness and residual strength of the laminate to the number of cycles. All model components have been programmed in the ANSYS FE code in order to create a user{\^a}friendly macro{\^a}routine. The model has been applied in two different quasi{\^a}isotropic CFRP laminates subjected to tension{\^a}compression (T{\^a}C) fatigue and the predictions of fatigue life and damage accumulation as a function of the number of cycles were compared with experimental data available in the literature. A very good agreement was obtained.}

    abstract    = {In the never-ending search for higher engine performance, the optimization of the blade tip geometry provides an opportunity to control the tip leakage flow, mitigate the rotor mixing losses and manage the heat load distributions. However, the setup of numerical flow simulations of a high-pressure turbine stage for the purpose of blade tip geometry optimization is subjected to conflicting requirements: the computational demands have to be low enough to run a sufficiently large number of direct evaluations within a limited period of time, whereas the numerical model must guarantee sufficient accuracy in the prediction of the relevant flow physics that drives variations in the performance objectives. This paper evaluates the options for the setup of numerical simulations suitable for CFD-based blade tip optimization and assesses the impact of the CFD methods on the computation accuracy with emphasis on rotor tip flow prediction. The numerical study is performed with
                  the Numeca FINE/Turbo and FINE/Open commercial RANS solvers on a set of optimised blade tip geometries in a high-pressure gas turbine stage. The domain is meshed with either an unstructured or a multi-block structured grid in order to assess the influence of domain discretization methods on performance parameters quantification. The location of the high-pressure stage after the combustor poses increased demands on turbulence modelling due to the high inlet turbulence intensity. This work compares the performance of the one-equation Spalart-Allmaras (SA) and the two-equation k-ɛ and k-$\omega$ SST. Another section is dedicated to methods for modelling of stator-rotor interaction. Domain restriction to rotor-only is attractive for its low computational demands, but it does not allow to include the stator-rotor interaction effects. This method is compared against a full-stage setup, empolying either the commonly used steady computation with mixing plane or the
                  Non-Linear Harmonics method which allows to capture the unsteady blade-passing effects. The computations are validated by experimental data available from a large scale high-speed turbine facility, employing a rainbow rotor approach to allow the simultaneous aerothermal testing of multiple optimized blade tip geometries.}

    abstract    = {Direct-type global optimization algorithms often spend an excessive number of function evaluations on problems with many local optima exploring suboptimal local minima, thereby delaying discovery of the global minimum. In this paper, a globally-biased simplicial partition Disimpl algorithm for global optimization of expensive Lipschitz continuous functions with an unknown Lipschitz constant is proposed. A scheme for an adaptive balancing of local and global information during the search is introduced, implemented, experimentally investigated, and compared with the well-known Direct and Directl methods. Extensive numerical experiments executed on 800 multidimensional multiextremal test functions show a promising performance of the new acceleration technique with respect to competitors.}

It has been demonstrated in [74, 116, 126, 134] that estimation of the local Lipschitz constants during the search allows significant acceleration of the global search. Naturally, balancing between the local and global information must be performed in an appropriate way to increase the speed of optimization and avoid the missing of the global solution.}

    abstract    = {We consider a global optimization problem for Lipschitz-continuous functions with an unknown Lipschitz constant. Our approach is based on the well-known DIRECT (DIviding RECTangles) algorithm and motivated by the diagonal partitioning strategy. One of the main advantages of the diagonal partitioning scheme is that the objective function is evaluated at two points at each hyper-rectangle and, therefore, more comprehensive information about the objective function is considered than using the central sampling strategy used in most DIRECT-type algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new DIRECT-type algorithm, which we call BIRECT (BIsecting RECTangles). In this algorithm, a bisection is used instead of a trisection which is typical for diagonal-based and DIRECT-type algorithms. The bisection is preferable to the trisection because of the shapes of hyper-rectangles, but usual evaluation of the objective function at the center or at the endpoints of the diagonal are not
                  favorable for bisection. In the proposed algorithm the objective function is evaluated at two points on the diagonal equidistant between themselves and the endpoints of a diagonal. This sampling strategy enables reuse of the sampling points in descendant hyper-rectangles. The developed algorithm gives very competitive numerical results compared to the DIRECT algorithm and its well know modifications.}

This problem is challenging for numerical methods due to the practical limits on computational budget often required by intelligent systems. For its efficient solution, a new DIRECT-type hybrid technique is proposed. The new algorithm incorporates a novel sampling on diagonals and bisection strategy (instead of a trisection which is commonly used in the existing DIRECT-type algorithms), embedded into the globally-biased framework, and enriched with three different local minimization strategies. The numerical results on a test set of almost 900 problems from the literature and on a real-life application regarding nonlinear regression show that the new approach effectively addresses well-known DIRECT weaknesses, has beneficial effects on the overall performance, and on average, gives significantly better results compared to several DIRECT-type methods widely used in
                  decision-making expert systems.}

    abstract    = {Harnessing modern parallel computing resources to achieve complex multiphysics simulations is a daunting task. The Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) aims to enable such development by providing simplified interfaces for specification of partial differential equations, boundary conditions, material properties, and all aspects of a simulation without the need to consider the parallel, adaptive, nonlinear, finite element solve that is handled internally. Through the use of interfaces and inheritance, each portion of a simulation becomes reusable and composable in a manner that allows disparate research groups to share code and create an ecosystem of growing capability that lowers the barrier for the creation of multiphysics simulation codes. Included within the framework is a unique capability for building multiscale, multiphysics simulations through simultaneous execution of multiple sub-applications with data transfers between the scales.
                  Other capabilities include automatic differentiation, scaling to a large number of processors, hybrid parallelism, and mesh adaptivity. To date, MOOSE-based applications have been created in areas of science and engineering such as nuclear physics, geothermal science, magneto-hydrodynamics, seismic events, compressible and incompressible fluid flow, microstructure evolution, and advanced manufacturing processes.}

    abstract    = {We study preconditioners for the iterative solution of the linear systems arising in the implicit time integration of the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. The spatial discretization is carried out using a discontinuous Galerkin method with fourth order polynomial interpolations on triangular elements. The time integration is based on backward difference formulas resulting in a nonlinear system of equations which is solved at each timestep. This is accomplished using Newton's method. The resulting linear systems are solved using a preconditioned GMRES iterative algorithm. We consider several existing preconditioners such as block Jacobi and Gauss--Seidel combined with multilevel schemes which have been developed and tested for specific applications. While our results are consistent with the claims reported, we find that these preconditioners lack robustness when used in more challenging situations involving low Mach numbers, stretched grids, or high Reynolds
                  number turbulent flows. We propose a preconditioner based on a coarse scale correction with postsmoothing based on a block incomplete LU factorization with zero fill-in (ILU0) of the Jacobian matrix. The performance of the ILU0 smoother is found to depend critically on the element numbering. We propose a numbering strategy based on minimizing the discarded fill-in in a greedy fashion. The coarse scale correction scheme is found to be important for diffusion dominated problems, whereas the ILU0 preconditioner with the proposed ordering is effective at handling the convection dominated case. While little can be said in the way of theoretical results, the proposed preconditioner is shown to perform remarkably well for a broad range of representative test problems. These include compressible flows ranging from very low Reynolds numbers to fully turbulent flows using the Reynolds averaged Navier--Stokes equations discretized on highly stretched grids. For low Mach number
                  flows, the proposed preconditioner is more than one order of magnitude more efficient than the other preconditioners considered.}

Figure 2 illustrates the process. The CFD results of the studies are analyzed using a wake analysis method. The wake analysis method quantifies the wake structures in terms of engine power, allowing different types of propeller to be analyzed and their losses compared on equal terms. The change in the energy flow passing through the propeller disk area is related to the work added to the flow. The kinetic energy is breakdown into entropy lost work, reversible pressure changes, and kinetic and turbulent energy changes.}

    abstract    = {Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capable air vehicles such as quadcopters are being considered for a vast array of missions requiring longer endurance in hover, faster travel times, and higher payload capacities. For this reason, hybrid air vehicles that incorporate the design features of rotorcraft and fixed wing vehicles appear to be promising candidates for these missions. One such hybrid vehicle, the quadrotor biplane, has been explored for package delivery capability. This vehicle configuration has two wings placed perpendicular and below four proprotors in a biplane configuration. The vehicle uses conventional quadrotor control methodology for flight control in both hover and froward flight mode. It enters hover in tail-sitter configuration and utilizes differential thrust vectors to pitch forward into forward flight configuration. Using differential RPM in place of conventional control surfaces greatly reduces mechanical complexity. The vehicle design and
                  package delivery functionality have been validated experimentally, in both hover and forward flight, with a test vehicle that has a gross takeoff weight (GTOW) of 3.76 kg and a 0.45 kg payload capacity. To characterize the flight performance of this vehicle design during its transition between the two flight modes, a comprehensive sensor suite paired with a flight data recorder system were designed and incorporated into the vehicle. Motor RPM was measured with hall effect sensors, while a combined voltage and current sensor measures the power consumption from the main battery. A barometric pressure, temperature, and altitude sensor was integrated to determine the atmospheric conditions. Lastly, a custom 2-D flow probe designed in-house has been implemented to measure airspeed and angle of attack of the fuselage body relative to the oncoming wind. In forward flight, the vehicle was flown with no payload and was shown to require 138 W, 68\% less power than the 430 W
                  needed in hover. This efficiency gain occurred when the vehicle pitched to 55.8 * from vertical, with no payload, while flying at 7.31 m/s with respect to the wind. Another observation made from flight data in hover indicates that increasing the size of the payload from 0 to 1lb (empty to full) increases the amount of power required by 18\%.}

One of the most challenging issues in multi-disciplinary optimization is to bring together technologies and methodologies of various disciplines in a way that is both practical and inclusive of the expertise that must accompany these individual technologies. The approach taken by the Advanced Aerodynamics Department at Bombardier Aerospace is to build each component of the methodology in a stepwise fashion from the ground up and integrate the engineering analysis and design tools already in place at Bombardier. The methodology is based on the integration of low and high fidelity computational fluid dynamics codes into the multidisciplinary environment, the development of conceptual wing structural design codes, wing weight estimation codes, En Route fuel burn prediction models and codes for the prediction of wing static
                  aeroelastic deformation under load. Once a multi-disciplinary optimum design is obtained using low fidelity codes, this preliminary design undergoes a second refinement stage of optimization using high fidelity codes.}

The purpose of this article is to look to the future and help stimulate drone routing research in directions we hope will prove interesting and fruitful. We discuss opportunities for better modeling of (1) drone capabilities for both existing drones and those likely to be used in the future, (2) constraints on drone performance and operations, (3) different objectives for various drone services, and (4) alternative delivery modes, as well as some areas for methodological advances and some possible new applications. While much of the research to date has leveraged existing TSP (traveling salesman problem), VRP (vehicle routing problem), and arc routing models, we look forward to new contributions from drone research that use better models of more realistic drone types and new drone applications.}

    abstract    = {We present the black hole accretion code (BHAC), a new multidimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics module for the MPI-AMRVAC framework [1, 2]. BHAC has been designed to solve the equations of ideal general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in arbitrary spacetimes and exploits adaptive mesh refinement techniques with an efficient block-based approach. Several spacetimes have already been implemented and tested. We demonstrate the validity of BHAC by means of various one-, two-, and three-dimensional test problems, as well as through a close comparison with the HARM3D code in the case of a torus accreting onto a black hole. The convergence of a turbulent accretion scenario is investigated with several diagnostics and we find accretion rates and horizon-penetrating fluxes to be convergent to within a few percent when the problem is run in three dimensions. Our analysis also involves the study of the corresponding thermal synchrotron emission, which is
                  performed by means of a new general-relativistic radiative transfer code, BHOSS. The resulting synthetic intensity maps of accretion onto black holes are found to be convergent with increasing resolution and are anticipated to play a crucial role in the interpretation of horizon-scale images resulting from upcoming radio observations of the source at the Galactic Center.}

    abstract    = {An iterative algorithm is proposed for nonlinearly constrained optimization calculations when there are no derivatives. Each iteration forms linear approximations to the objective and constraint functions by interpolation at the vertices of a simplex and a trust region bound restricts each change to the variables. Thus a new vector of variables is calculated, which may replace one of the current vertices, either to improve the shape of the simplex or because it is the best vector that has been found so far, according to a merit function that gives attention to the greatest constraint violation. The trust region radius $\rho$ is never increased, and it is reduced when the approximations of a well-conditioned simplex fail to yield an improvement to the variables, until $\rho$ reaches a prescribed value that controls the final accuracy. Some convergence properties and several numerical results are given, but there are no more than 9 variables in these calculations
                  because linear approximations can be highly inefficient. Nevertheless, the algorithm is easy to use for small numbers of variables.}

The revised formula utilizes the same principles and retains the same simple form of the original formula but provides a more appropriate and acceptable basis for gust-load calculations. The gust factor is calculated on the basis of a one-minus-cosine gust shape and is presented as a function of a mass-ratio parameter in contrast to the ramp gust shape and wing loading, respectively, used for the alleviation factor. A summary of gust-velocity data from v-g records taken on civil transport airplanes from 1933 to 1950, reevaluated by the revised formula, is also presented.}

    abstract    = {DIRECT is a popular deterministic algorithm for global optimization problems. It can find the basins of attraction for global or local optima efficiently, especially when dimension is small. Recently, we have proposed a class of modified DIRECT algorithms to eliminate the sensitivities of the original DIRECT to linear scaling of the objective function. In this paper, we devote to find a specific algorithm with best performance among this class. We compare the performance of the modified DIRECT algorithms on the GKLS test set. Numerical results show that DIRECT-median performs outstanding among this class. What is more, numerical results also show that DIRECT-median can find solutions with high accuracy much more efficiently than the original DIRECT.}

    abstract    = {A major challenge to the successful full-scale development of modern aerospace systems is to address competing objectives such as improved performance, reduced costs, and enhanced safety. Accurate, high-fidelity models are typically time consuming and computationally expensive. Furthermore, informed decisions should be made with an understanding of the impact (global sensitivity) of the design variables on the different objectives. In this context, the so-called surrogate-based approach for analysis and optimization can play a very valuable role. The surrogates are constructed using data drawn from high-fidelity models, and provide fast approximations of the objectives and constraints at new design points, thereby making sensitivity and optimization studies feasible. This paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the fundamental issues that arise in surrogate-based analysis and optimization (SBAO), highlighting concepts, methods, techniques, as well as practical
                  implications. The issues addressed include the selection of the loss function and regularization criteria for constructing the surrogates, design of experiments, surrogate selection and construction, sensitivity analysis, convergence, and optimization. The multi-objective optimal design of a liquid rocket injector is presented to highlight the state of the art and to help guide future efforts.}

The current version of the algorithm produces notable results for maximizing lift-to-drag and for minimizing drag. Test cases for a Reynolds number of 200,000 and an increased lift-to-drag from 55.0 to 71.0 (angle of attack of 2 degrees) and reduced coefficient of drag from 107.4 counts to 60.7 counts (angle of attack of 0 degrees), where each objective function optimization was run separately. The algorithm is rapid in that it can design and evaluate an airfoil within approximately 0.2 to 0.3 seconds. The optimization routine is proved to show promise in being extended to a wider range of objective functions such as, for example, maximizing laminar run or determining an optimal flap deflection angle. Limitations of the current implementation center on the simplicity of the elected conformal mapping method and the lack of rigorous constraints. Future
                  improvements to the optimization routine are poised to be integrated readily. }

    abstract    = {The manuscript presents a novel aero-hydro-servo-elastic coupling framework, MIRAS-HAWC2. In this coupling, the wind turbine blades and rotor-wake aerodynamics are modeled using a modified lifting-line theory which accounts for blade curvature, combined with a hybrid vortex method. The wind turbine structure and foundation are modeled using a finite-element and multi-body system approach. Last, hydrodynamics are modeled using Airy wave theory together with Morison's equation. An initial assessment of the performance of the aeroelastic coupling framework has been performed for steady rotor-only cases, assuming laminar inflow without shear. This included a comparison against fully resolved computational fluid dynamics, for both stiff and flexible blades showing an excellent agreement. In a second stage, the aero-hydro-servo-elastic coupling is used, comparing MIRAS-HAWC2 as well as blade-element momentum-based simulations with selected results from the Offshore Code
                  Comparison Collaboration projects (OC3 and OC4), which study the NREL 5 MW turbine mounted on different offshore support structures. A good agreement has been obtained for the simulations of a monopile with rigid foundation, a tripod, and jacket support structures.}

A matrix-free Newton--Krylov--Schwarz algorithm with one-level and two-level nonoverlapping Schwarz preconditioners is used to solve the implicit systems. The study shows that this method is a factor of 50 faster than an explicit method that employs local time-stepping to accelerate convergence to steady-state solution. Procedures using LU-SGS preconditioner appear to provide the best performance. The two-level procedure is found necessary for relatively fast convergence in the case of large numbers of mesh elements.}

    abstract    = {Process flexibility and design under uncertainty have been researched extensively in the literature. Problem formulations for flexibility include nested optimization problems and these can often be refined by substituting the optimality conditions for these nested problems. However, these reformulations are highly constrained and can be expensive to solve. In this paper we extend algorithms to solve these reformulated NLP problem under uncertainty by introducing two contributions to this approach. These are the use of a Constraint Aggregation function (KS function) and Smoothing Functions. We begin with basic properties of KS function. Next, we review a class of parametric smooth functions, used to replace the complementarity conditions of the KKT conditions with a well-behaved, smoothed nonlinear equality constraint. In this paper we apply the previous strategies to two specific problems: i) the?worst case algorithm?, that assesses design under uncertainty and, ii)
                  the flexibility index and feasibility test formulations. In the first case, two new algorithms are derived, one of them being single level optimization problem. Next using similar ideas, both flexibility index and feasibility test are reformulated leading to a single non linear programming problem instead of a mixed integer non linear programming one. The new formulations are demonstrated on five different example problems where a CPU time reduction of more than 70 and 80{\%} is demonstrated.}

    abstract    = { High-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations is used to optimize the aerodynamic performance of a conventional tube-and-wing design, a hybrid wing-body, and a novel lifting-fuselage concept for regional-class aircraft. Trim-constrained drag minimization is performed on a hybrid wing-body design, with an optimized conventional design serving as a performance reference. The optimized regional-class hybrid wing-body yields no drag savings when compared with the conventional reference aircraft. Starting from the optimized hybrid wing-body, an exploratory optimization with significant geometric freedom is then performed, resulting in a novel shape with a slender lifting fuselage and distinct wings. Based on this exploratory result, a new regional-class lifting-fuselage configuration is designed and optimized. With a span constrained by code ``C'' gate limits and having the same wing-only span as the conventional
                  reference aircraft, this new design produces up to 10\% lower drag than the reference aircraft. The effect of structural weight uncertainties, cruise altitude, and stability requirements are also examined.}

    abstract    = {An efficient and robust time integration procedure for a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method is introduced for solving nonlinear second-order partial differential equations. The time discretization is based on an explicit formulation for the hyperbolic term and an implicit formulation for the parabolic term. The procedure uses an iterative algorithm with reduced evaluation cost. The size of the linear system to be solved is greatly reduced thanks to partial uncoupling in space between low-order and high-order degrees of freedom. Numerical examples are presented for the nonlinear convection-diffusion equation in one and two dimensions including steady and unsteady flow problems. The performance of the present method is investigated in terms of CPU time and compared to a fully implicit method. A von Neumann stability analysis is carried out in order to determine the stability and damping properties of the method. Besides a fairly reduced CPU effort, numerical
                  results demonstrate better convergence properties of the present algorithm when compared to the fully implicit method.}

    abstract    = {We present an efficient and easy to implement approach to solving the semidiscrete equation systems resulting from time discretization of nonlinear parabolic problems with discontinuous Galerkin methods of order 𝑟rr. It is based on applying Newton's method and decoupling the Newton update equation, which consists of a coupled system of 𝑟+1r+1r+1 elliptic problems. In order to avoid complex coefficients which arise inevitably in the equations obtained by a direct decoupling, we decouple not the exact Newton update equation but a suitable approximation. The resulting solution scheme is shown to possess fast linear convergence and consists of several steps with same structure as implicit Euler steps. We construct concrete realizations for order one to three and give numerical evidence that the required computing time is reduced significantly compared to assembling and solving the complete coupled system by Newton's method.}

In this paper we study the effect of c on the quality of fit of the multiquadric, inverse multiquadric and Gaussian interpolants. We show, numerically, that the value of the optimal c (the value of c that minimizes the interpolation error) depends on the number and distribution of data points, on the data vector, and on the precision of the computation. We present an algorithm for selecting a good value for c that implicitly takes all the above considerations into account. The algorithm selects c by minimizing a cost function that imitates the error between the radial interpolant and the (unknown) function from which the data vector was sampled. The cost function is defined by taking some norm of the error vector E = (E1, ... , EN)T where Ek = Ek = fk - Sk xk) and Sk is the interpolant to a reduced data set obtained by
                  removing the point xk and the corresponding data value fk from the original data set. The cost function can be defined for any radial basis function and any dimension. We present the results of many numerical experiments involving interpolation of two dimensional data sets by the multiquadric, inverse multiquadric and Gaussian interpolants and we show that our algorithm consistently produces good values for the parameter c.}

The temper- ature profile shows a break in gradient around 49 m depth, which we model with inverse numerical simulations, indicat- ing that surface warming started around the austral summer of 1980/81 AD $\pm$5 yr. This warming of approximately 0.37 K per decade is consistent with trends seen in both instrumen- tal and other reconstructions for Antarctica and, therefore, suggests that regional- rather than local-scale processes are largely responsible. Alteration of the surface energy budget arising from changes in radiation balances due to local cloud, the amount of liquid deposition and local air temperatures as- sociated with altered air/sea exchanges also potentially plays a role at this location
                  due to the proximity of the Shackleton Ice Shelf and sea-ice zone.}

    abstract    = {This paper examines the design of adaptive laminar airfoils in the transonic flow regime using the γ-Re˜θt model as a transition prediction method. A robust solution procedure for the transition model is described and a grid convergence study is presented. Predictions from the model are then compared to an extensive set of experimental results containing transition measurements on a morphing airfoil. It is shown that the sensitivity of the γ-Re˜θt transition model with respect to shape variations allows its use in a design framework. Using a multi-point optimization strategy, the model is then used to design transonic airfoils suitable for a range of flow conditions. The potential improvement in drag associated with the implementation of adaptive airfoil technology is then carefully quantified using single-point optimization with the multi-point designed airfoil as a reference. Structural design constraints are taken into account to obtain a realistic estimate
                  of possible drag reduction through airfoil morphing using current wing construction technology. Airfoil drag improvements of up to 4.6\% are obtained through morphing of the section of upper surface located between the wing spars with respect to the baseline multi-point design in flow conditions typical of large business jet operation.}

Powell has essentially shown that the rate of convergence is linear if one starts with a sufficiently high penalty factor and sufficiently near to a local solution satisfying the usual second-order sufficient conditions for optimality. This paper furnishes the corresponding method for inequality-constrained problems. Global convergence to an optimal solution is established in the convex case for an arbitrary penalty factor and without the requirement that an exact minimum be calculated at each cycle. Furthermore, the Lagrange multipliers are shown to converge, even though the optimal multipliers may not be unique.}

    abstract    = {Traditional approaches to the design and optimization of a new system often use a system-centric objective that does not consider how the operator will use this new system alongside other existing systems. When the new system design is incorporated into the broader group of systems, the performance of the operator-level objective can be suboptimal due to the unmodeled interaction between the new system and the other systems. Among the few available references that describe attempts to address this disconnect, most follow an multidisciplinary design and optimization-motivated sequential decomposition approach of first designing an optimal system and then providing this system to the operator who decides the best way to use this new system along with the existing systems. This paper addresses this issue by including aircraft design, airline operations, and revenue management ``subspaces''; and it presents an approach that could simultaneously solve these subspaces
                  while posed as a monolithic optimization problem. The monolithic approach makes the problem an expensive mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and is extremely difficult to solve. A recently developed optimization framework is used that simultaneously solves the subspaces to capture the ``synergy'' in the problem. The results demonstrate that simultaneously optimizing the subspaces leads to significant improvement in the fleet-level objective of the airline when compared to the previously developed sequential subspace decomposition approach. The results also showcase that maximizing the revenue and minimizing the operating cost independently need not lead to a maximized profit solution for the airline.}

An important design criterion of the power net is the voltage stability during peak loads. This paper describes a simulation-based optimization method to fulfill the voltage stability requirements in a minimum-weight configuration of the power net. The method is applied to different power net topologies which are configured using a mixture of discrete and continuous parameters. Finally, the performance of the optimization algorithm as well as the optimization results are presented and evaluated.}

To remedy this situation, this paper reviews past literatures on structural optimization with emphasis on their relation to mechanical product development, and discusses open research issues that would further enhance the industry acceptance of structural optimization. The past literatures are categorized based on their major research focuses: geometry parameterization, approximation methods, optimization algorithms, and the integration with nonstructural issues. Open problems in each category and anticipated future trends briefly are discussed.}}

    abstract    = {We present the design of a high-performance, object oriented framework that enables the rapid development and usage of efficient, scalable and portable implementations of multilevel preconditioners for distributed sparse real matrices, in both serial and (massively) parallel environments. The main feature of the proposed framework is the use of several programming paradigms for the diffierent implementation layers, with a strong emphasis on object oriented classes and operator overloading for the top layer, and optimized FORTRAN and C code for the layers underneath. We describe an implementation of the proposed framework, based on the ML library, the algebraic multilevel preconditioning package of Trilinos, which supports state-of-the-art parallel smoothed aggregation methods, and can be used to define general algebraic and geometric multilevel and multigrid preconditioners and solvers. The paper demonstrates that one can take advantage of object-oriented programming
                  and operator overloading to obtain intuitive, easy-to-read and easy-to-develop codes, that are at the same time efficient and scalable. Several numerical experiments, obtained on serial and parallel computers, show that the overhead required by the object-oriented layer is very modest, therefore allowing developers to focus on the new algorithms they are developing and testing, rather than on the implementation details.}

Most current performance prediction tools make use of the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) model, based upon a number of simplifying assumptions that hold only under steady conditions. This is why a lifting line free vortex wake (LLFVW) algorithm is used here to accurately resolve unsteady wind turbine aerodynamics. A coupling to the structural analysis tool BeamDyn, based on geometrically exact beam theory, allows for time-resolved aeroelastic simulations with highly deflected blades including bend-twist, coupling. Predictions of blade loading and deformation for rigid and flexible blades are analysed with reference to different aerodynamic and structural approaches. The emergency shutdown procedure is chosen as an examplary design load case causing large deflections to place emphasis on the influence of structural coupling and demonstrate the necessity of high
                  fidelity structural models.}

They cover angles of attack ranging from 3� to 15�, vapor cavitation numbers from 0.06 to 2.34, depths of submergence of J and 1 chord, and velocities from 30 to 52 fps. It is found that, at vapor cavitation numbers that are low enough to approach prototype values, the ventilation hysteresis is eliminated. Results are presented in the form of tables and graphs of lift and drag coefficients for variations of angle of attack and vapor cavitation numbers. Good agreement is found between theory and experiment. The problems of ventilation inception are also discussed.}

    abstract    = {Synthesis has been defined as the rational directed evolu- tion of a system configuration which, in terms of a defined criterion, efficiently performs a set of specified functional purposes. This document presents the application of the syn- thesis concept to a system with an aeroelastic technology, Specifically, the system is a hollow symmetric double wedge air- foil. There are two design variables; airfoil thickness and chord length. Behavior constraints are root angle of attack, tip deflection, flutter Mach number, and root stress. Side constraints of the design parameters are provided. The basic criterion function is the total energy required to drive the airfoil through a sequence of flight conditions. Trade off of weight versus energy is studied using airfoil weight as an additional behavior constraint. The gradient steep-descent alternate step synthesis method is used. Numerical results of three example syntheses and a trade-off study are included. The results
                  indicate that the synthesis concept may be applied successfully to an aeroelastic system. The study should be extended to consider the system as a plate structure rather than assuming beam type structural action.}

    abstract    = {The present study demonstrates the aerodynamic and acoustic optimization potential of a counter rotating open rotor. The objective was to maximize the propeller efficiency at top-of-climb conditions and to minimize the noise emission at takeoff while fulfilling the given thrust specifications at two operating conditions (Takeoff and Top of Climb) considered. Both objectives were successfully met by applying an efficient multi-objective optimization procedure in combination with a 3D RANS method. The acoustic evaluation was carried out with a coupled U-RANS and an analytic far field prediction method based on an integral Ffowcs-Williams Hawkings approach. This first part of the paper deals with the application of DLR's CFD method TRACE to counter rotating open rotors. This study features the choice and placement of boundary conditions, resolution requirements and a corresponding meshing strategy. The aerodynamic performance in terms of thrust, torque and efficiency
                  was evaluated based on steady state calculations with a mixing plane placed in between both rotors, which allowed for an efficient and reliable evaluation of the performance, in particular within the automatic optimization. The aerodynamic optimization was carried by the application of AutoOpti, a multi-objective optimization procedure based on an evolutionary algorithm which also was developed at the Institute of propulsion technology at DLR. The optimization presented in this paper features more than 1600 converged 3D steady-state CFD simulations at two operating conditions, Takeoff and Top of Climb respectively. In order to accelerate the optimization process a surrogate model based on a Kriging interpolation on the response surfaces was introduced. The main constrains and regions of interest during the optimization where a given power split between the rotors at takeoff, retaining an axial outflow at the aft rotor exit at top of climb and fulfilling the given
                  thrust specifications at both operating conditions. Two objectives were defined: One was to maximize the (propeller) efficiency at top of climb conditions. The other objective was an acoustic criteria aiming at decreasing the rotor/rotor interaction noise at takeoff by smoothening the front rotor wakes. Approximately 100 geometric parameters were set free during the optimization to allow for a flexible definition of the 3D blade geometry in terms of rotor sweep, aft rotor clipping, hub contour as well as a flexible definition of different 2D profiles at different radial locations. The acoustic evaluation was carried out based on unsteady 3D-RANS computations with the same CFD method (TRACE) involving an efficient single-passage phase-lag approach. These unsteady results were coupled with the integral Ffowcs-Williams Hawkings method APSIM via a permeable control surface covering both rotors. The far field directivities and spectra for a linear microphone array were
                  evaluated, here mainly at the takeoff certification point. This (still time consuming) acoustic evaluation was carried out after the automatic optimization for a few of the most promising individuals only and results will be presented in comparison with the baseline configuration. This detailed acoustic evaluation also allowed for an assessment of the effectiveness of the acoustic cost function as introduced within the automatic optimization.}

    abstract    = {In this paper, a turbo-electric propulsion system was analyzed, and its performance was assessed. The aircraft considered here was a single-aisle, medium-range configuration targeting a capacity of 150 Pax. The propulsion concept comprised two boosted geared turbofan engines mounted under-wing. Those main engines were supported by an electrically driven aft-propulsor contributing to the thrust generation and by taking advantage of ingesting the boundary layer of the fuselage for potentially higher levels of propulsive efficiency and allowing for the improved operation of the main engines. The performance assessment as carried out in the context of this paper involved different levels: Firstly, based on the reference aircraft and the detailed description of its major components, the engine performance model for both main engines, as well as for the electrically driven aft-propulsor was set up. The methodology, as introduced, has already been applied in the context of
                  hybrid-electric propulsion and allowed for the aforementioned aircraft sizing, as well as the subsequent gas turbine multi-point synthesis (simulation). A geared turbofan architecture with 2035 technology assumptions was considered for the main engine configuration. The present trade study focused on the design and performance analysis of the aft-propulsor and how it affected the performance of the main engines, due to the electric power generation. In order to allow for a more accurate description of the performance of this particular module, the enhanced streamline curvature method with an underlying and pre-optimized profile database was used to design a propulsor tailored to meet the requirements of the aft propulsor as derived from the cycle synthesis and overall aircraft specification; existing design expertise for novel and highly integrated propulsors could be taken advantage of herein. The resulting performance characteristics from the streamline curvature
                  method were then fed back to the engine performance model in a closely coupled approach in order to have a more accurate description of the module behavior. This direct coupling allowed for enhanced sensitivity studies, monitoring different top-level parameters, such as the thrust/power split between the main engines and the aft propulsor. As a result, different propulsor specifications and fan designs with optimal performance characteristics were achieved, which in return affected the performance of all subsystems considered.}

    abstract    = {Engineering systems are now frequently optimized via computer models. The input-output relationships in these models are often highly nonlinear deterministic functions that are expensive to compute. Thus, when searching for the global optimum, it is desirable to minimize the number of function evaluations. Bayesian global optimization methods are well-suited to this task because they make use of all previous evaluations in selecting the next search point. A statistical model is fit to the sampled points which allows predictions to be made elsewhere, along with a measure of possible prediction error (uncertainty). The next point is chosen to maximize a criterion that balances searching where the predicted value of the function is good (local search) with searching where the uncertainty of prediction is large (global search). We extend this methodology in several ways. First, we introduce a parameter that controls the local-global balance. Secondly, we propose a method
                  for dealing with nonlinear inequality constraints from additional response variables. Lastly, we adapt the sequential algorithm to proceed in stages rather than one point at a time. The extensions are illustrated using a shape optimization problem from the automotive industry.}

    abstract    = {Recently, optimization has become an integral part of the aerodynamic design process chain. However, because of uncertainties with respect to the flight conditions and geometry uncertainties, a design optimized by a traditional design optimization method seeking only optimality may not achieve its expected performance. Robust optimization deals with optimal designs, which are robust with respect to small (or even large) perturbations of the optimization setpoint conditions. That means, the optimal designs computed should still be good designs, even if the input parameters for the optimization problem formulation are changed by a non-negligible amount. Thus even more experimental or numerical effort can be saved. In this paper, we aim at an improvement of existing simulation and optimization technology, developed in the German collaborative effort MEGADESIGN1, so that numerical uncertainties are identified, quantized and included in the overall optimization procedure,
                  thus making robust design in this sense possible. We introduce two robust formulations of the aerodynamic optimization problem which we numerically compare in a 2d testcase under uncertain flight conditions. Beside the scalar valued uncertainties we consider the shape itself as an uncertainty source and apply a Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve expansion to approximate the infinite-dimensional probability space. To overcome the curse of dimensionality an adaptively refined sparse grid is used in order to compute statistics of the solution.}

    abstract    = {Abstract Present day engineering optimization problems often impose large computational demands, resulting in long solution times even on a modern high-end processor. To obtain enhanced computational throughput and global search capability, we detail the coarse-grained parallelization of an increasingly popular global search method, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Parallel PSO performance was evaluated using two categories of optimization problems possessing multiple local minima---large-scale analytical test problems with computationally cheap function evaluations and medium-scale biomechanical system identification problems with computationally expensive function evaluations. For load-balanced analytical test problems formulated using 128 design variables, speedup was close to ideal and parallel efficiency above 95\% for up to 32 nodes on a Beowulf cluster. In contrast, for load-imbalanced biomechanical system identification problems with 12 design
                  variables, speedup plateaued and parallel efficiency decreased almost linearly with increasing number of nodes. The primary factor affecting parallel performance was the synchronization requirement of the parallel algorithm, which dictated that each iteration must wait for completion of the slowest fitness evaluation. When the analytical problems were solved using a fixed number of swarm iterations, a single population of 128 particles produced a better convergence rate than did multiple independent runs performed using sub-populations (8 runs with 16 particles, 4 runs with 32 particles, or 2 runs with 64 particles). These results suggest that (1) parallel PSO exhibits excellent parallel performance under load-balanced conditions, (2) an asynchronous implementation would be valuable for real-life problems subject to load imbalance, and (3) larger population sizes should be considered when multiple processors are available.

Starting from a short description of the system and its components, e.g. mesh adaptation or grid deformation, its basic capabilities are discussed. Thereafter recent and on-going developments are presented, such as the adjoint approach or a pilot installation exploiting structured grids. The remainder of the paper discusses a number of recent applications of varying complexity, both from DLR and aircraft industry, such as simulation of half-model effects in wind tunnels, effects of trailing edge devices on full aircraft configuration, flow about a helicopter fuselage and generic Arianne-type launcher, full aircraft simulations such as A380-type airplane with undercarriage or complete EF2000 . }

    abstract    = {Mesh generation for high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations and aerodynamic shape optimization is a time-consuming task. Complex geometries can be accurately modeled using overset meshes, whereby multiple high-quality structured meshes corresponding to different aircraft components overlap to model the full aircraft configuration. However, from the standpoint of geometry manipulation, most methods operate on the entire geometry rather than on separate components, which diminishes the advantages of overset meshes. To address this issue, a geometry module is introduced that operates on individual components and automatically computes their intersections to update overset meshes during optimization. Reverse-mode automatic differentiation is applied to compute partial derivatives across this geometry module so that it fits into an optimization framework that uses a hybrid adjoint method (known as ADjoint) to efficiently compute gradients for a large number
                  of design variables. By using these automatically updated meshes and the corresponding derivatives, the aerodynamic shape of the DLR-F6 geometry is optimized while allowing changes in the wing--fuselage intersection. Sixteen design variables control the fuselage shape, and 128 design variables determine the wing surface. Under transonic flight conditions, the optimization reduces drag by 15 counts (5\%) as compared with the baseline design.}

    abstract    = {The strut-braced wing aircraft configuration promises to reduce fuel burn by enabling higher spans that reduce lift-induced drag. A successful design for this configuration depends on a careful trade-off between the various sources of drag and structural weight. When using computational fluid dynamic tools for aerodynamic shape optimization, generating high-quality structured meshes for the strut-braced wing configuration becomes challenging, especially near junctions. Furthermore, mesh deformation procedures frequently generate negative volume cells when applied to these structured meshes during optimization. This paper addresses this issue by using overset meshes and a component-based parametrization technique to achieve a flexible design optimization cycle capable of handling changing junctions. This study uses this approach to minimize drag of the PADRI 2017 strut-braced wing benchmark for a fixed lift constraint at transonic flight conditions. The drag of the
                  optimized configuration is 15\% lower than the baseline due to the reduction of shocks and separation in the wing-strut junction region. This result represents an example in which high-fidelity modeling is required to quantify the benefits of a new aircraft configuration and address potential issues during the conceptual design.

    abstract    = {Mesh generation and deformation are critical elements in gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO). Improperly generated or deformed meshes may contain bad-quality cells that degrade the accuracy of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers. Moreover, an inefficient mesh deformation method can become the bottleneck for the entire ASO process. To perform practical ASO, mesh generation and deformation methods need to be automated, scalable, robust, and computationally efficient. This paper tackles these challenges by developing an efficient approach for generating high-quality structured meshes in a semi-automatic manner. An automatic mesh generation approach is also proposed to handle intersections of multiple structured meshes with the overset mesh approach. In addition to mesh generation, a flexible mesh deformation method is developed, along with an efficient approach for computing mesh deformation derivatives using automatic differentiation. Finally,
                  the performance of the proposed approaches is evaluated in terms of speed, scalability, and robustness. It is demonstrated that the mesh generation approach scales up to 100 million cells and 256~CPU-cores. In addition, the robust mesh deformation approach enables a large range of valid mesh deformations, which gives more freedom to explore the design space in ASO. Moreover, the mesh deformation and the computation of its derivatives require only 0.1 of the CFD runtime. The mesh generation and deformation approaches have been implemented in the pyHyp and IDWarp software packages, which are publicly available under open-source licenses. The proposed approaches have the potential to become useful tools to handle general ASO problems for aircraft, turbomachinery, and ground vehicles.}

Currently at TRL 1-2, CENTRELINE's target is to mature the technological key features of the PFC to TRL 3-4.

Previous work demonstrated that there is a trade-off between high-speed performance and low-speed stability. Numerical optimization presents the opportunity to obtain the best high-speed performance while enforcing stability at low speeds. We perform RANS-based aerodynamic shape optimization with a component-based geometry parameterization approach that enables the optimization of a complex three-surface supersonic transport configuration. We minimize drag at a supersonic cruise condition both with and without a constraint on subsonic pitch stability. The stability constraint enforces a 5\% static margin at a subsonic takeoff condition. We show that shape optimization increases the wing thickness and leading edge radius to design a cranked arrow wing that is stable at subsonic speeds at the cost of a 5.8\% increase in supersonic drag.}

This work uses trim-constrained drag minimization to compare the trim drag for three-surface, canard, and conventional variants of a supersonic transport aircraft. We first use RANS-based optimization to determine the minimum trim drag for a fixed planform geometry at a subsonic takeoff condition and a supersonic cruise condition. The three-surface configuration has the lowest trim drag at the supersonic condition. The canard and three-surface configurations have comparable trim drag at the subsonic condition. We then construct a supersonic buildup model to study the effects of variable trim surface sizing. When the trim surface spans are included as design variables, the design for minimum supersonic drag has practically no tail and a canard sized at 36% of the wing half-span. These
                  results suggest that a canard configuration is best for supersonic trim drag.}

Three new algorithms are introduced: the first used the exact a priori known Lipschitz constant for derivatives; the second, when this constant is unknown, estimates it during the course of the search and finally, the last method uses neither the exact global Lipschitz constant nor its estimate but instead adaptively estimates the local Lipschitz constants in different sectors of the search region during the course of optimization.

In order to bridge the gap between these communities we propose a visual technique for a systematic comparison of global optimization algorithms having different nature. Results of more than 800,000 runs on 800 randomly generated tests show that both stochastic nature-inspired metaheuristics and deterministic global optimization methods are competitive and surpass one another in dependence on the available budget of function evaluations.}

One of the desirable properties of global optimization methods is strong homogeneity meaning that a method produces the same sequences of points where the objective function is evaluated independently both of multiplication of the function by a scaling constant and of adding a shifting constant. In this paper, several aspects of global optimization using strongly homogeneous methods are considered. First, it is shown that even if a method possesses this property theoretically, numerically very small and large scaling constants can lead to ill-conditioning of the scaled problem. Second, a new class of global optimization problems where the objective function can have not only finite but also infinite or infinitesimal Lipschitz constants is introduced. Third, the strong homogeneity of several Lipschitz global optimization
                  algorithms is studied in the framework of the Infinity Computing paradigm allowing one to work numerically with a variety of infinities and infinitesimals. Fourth, it is proved that a class of efficient univariate methods enjoys this property for finite, infinite and infinitesimal scaling and shifting constants. Finally, it is shown that in certain cases the usage of numerical infinities and infinitesimals can avoid ill-conditioning produced by scaling. Numerical experiments illustrating theoretical results are described.}

    abstract    = {Hybrid-electric aircraft are a potential way to reduce the environmental footprint of aviation. Research aimed at this subject has been pursued over the last decade; nevertheless, at this stage, a full overall aircraft design procedure is still an open issue. This work proposes to enrich the procedure for the conceptual design of hybrid aircraft found in literature through the definition of a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) framework aimed at handling design problems for such kinds of aircraft. The MDO technique has been chosen because the hybrid aircraft design problem shows more interaction between disciplines than a conventional configuration, and the classical approach based on multidisciplinary design analysis may neglect relevant features. The procedure has been tested on the case study of a single-aisle aircraft featuring hybrid propulsion with distributed electric ducted fans. The analysis considers three configurations (with 16, 32, and 48
                  electric motors) compared with a conventional baseline at the same 2035 technological horizon. To demonstrate the framework's capability, these configurations are optimized with respect to fuel and energy consumption. It is shown that the hybrid-electric concept consumes less fuel/energy when it flies on short range due to the partial mission electrification. When one increases the design range, penalties in weight introduced by hybrid propulsion overcome the advantages of electrified mission segment: the range for which hybrid aircraft have the same performance of the reference conventional aircraft is named the ``breakdown range.'' Starting from this range, the concept is no longer advantageous compared to conventional aircraft. Furthermore, a tradeoff between aerodynamic and propulsive efficiency is detected, and the optimal configuration is the one that balances these two effects. Finally, multiobjective optimization is performed to establish a tradeoff between
                  airframe weight and energy consumption.}

    abstract    = {Discrete truss sizing problems are very challenging to solve due to their combinatorial, nonlinear, non-convex nature. Consequently, truss sizing problems become unsolvable as the size of the truss grows. To address this issue, we consider various mathematical formulations for the truss design problem with the objective of minimizing weight, while the cross-sectional areas of the bars take only discrete values. Euler buckling constraints, Hooke's law, and bounds for stress and displacements are also considered. We propose mixed integer linear optimization (MILO) reformulations of the non-convex mixed integer models. The resulting MILO models are not solvable with existing MILO solvers as the size of the problem grows. Our novel methodology provides high-quality solutions for large-scale real truss sizing problems, as demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments.}

In this paper, we propose a novel mixed integer linear optimization (MILO) model for the TTDSO problem with discrete cross-sectional areas and Euler buckling constraints. Random perturbations of external forces are used to obtain kinematically stable structures. We prove that, by considering appropriate perturbed external forces, the resulting structure is kinematically stable with probability one. Furthermore, we show that necessary conditions for kinematic stability can be used to speed up the solution of discrete TTDSO problems. Using the proposed TTDSO model, the MILO solver provides optimal or near optimal solutions for trusses with up to 990 bars. }

The application of established, large-scale, optimization algorithms to the complete model is nearly impossible. Hierarchical decompositions are inappropriate for these types of problems and do not parallelize well. Sobieszczanski-Sobieski has proposed a nonhierarchical decomposition strategyfor nonlinear constrained optimization that is naturally parallel. Despite some successes on engineering problems, the algorithm as originally proposed fails on simple two-dimensional quadratic programs. This paper demonstrates the failure of the algorithm for quadratic programs and suggests a number of possible modifications.}

In FLT-AKM, a probability of constrained improvement (PCI) criterion is developed based on the notion of filter to sequentially generate new samples for updating Kriging metamodels of objective and constraints. At each iteration, an infill sample point is allocated at the position where the PCI is maximized to achieve potential improvement in optimality and feasibility. And the Kriging metamodels are consecutively updated by the newly-added infill sample points, which leads the FLT-AKM search to rapidly converge to the global optimum. The performance of the proposed FLT-AKM method is tested on a number of numerical benchmark problems via comparing with several widely-used metamodel-based constrained optimization methods. The comparison results
                  indicate that FLT-AKM generally outperforms the competitors in terms of global convergence and efficiency performance. Finally, FLT-AKM is successfully applied to an all-electric GEO satellite MDO problem. The optimization results show that FLT-AKM is able to find a better feasible design with fewer computational budgets compared with our previous study, which demonstrates the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed FLT-AKM method for solving real-world expensive black-box engineering design optimization problems.}

    abstract    = {Natural laminar-flow wings are one of the most promising technologies for reducing fuel burn and emissions for commercial aviation. However, there is a lack of tools for performing shape optimization of wings based on computational fluid dynamics considering laminar-to-turbulent transition. To address this need, we develop a discrete adjoint-based optimization framework where transition is modeled. The core of this framework is a Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes solver that is coupled with a simplified e^N method to predict Tollmien--Schlichting and laminar separation-induced transition that consists of a laminar boundary-layer code and a database method for flow stability analysis. The transition prediction is integrated with a Spalart--Allmaras turbulence model through a smoothed intermittency function, which makes it suitable for gradient-based optimization. A coupled-adjoint approach that uses transpose Jacobian-vector products derived via automatic
                  differentiation computes the transition prediction derivatives. Lift-constrained drag minimizations of airfoils for a single-point design and a multipoint design problem are performed. The results show that the optimizer successfully reduces the drag coefficient by increasing the extent of laminar flow. The multipoint optimization formulation produces an airfoil with a significant amount of laminar flow that is maintained at several flight conditions. The proposed methods make it possible to perform aerodynamic shape optimization considering laminar-to-turbulent transition in airfoil optimization.}

    abstract    = {Natural laminar flow is one of the most promising ways to reduce the drag of future aircraft configurations. However, there is a lack of efficient tools for performing shape optimization considering laminar-to-turbulent transition. This is in part because including crossflow instabilities in the optimization is challenging. This paper addresses this need by developing a discrete, adjoint-based optimization framework where transition is modeled considering both Tollmien and Schlichting waves and crossflow instabilities. The framework is based on a Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes computational fluid dynamics solver coupled with a transition simulation module externally by incorporating into the Spalart--Allmaras turbulence model through a smooth intermittency function. The transition simulation module consists of a laminar boundary-layer equations solver and a simplified stability analysis method based on the Drela--Giles method and the C1 criterion. A Jacobian-free
                  coupled-adjoint method is used to compute the gradients of the transition prediction. Lift-constrained drag minimization of a transonic infinite span wing with 25 deg of sweep is performed. The optimizer successfully reduces the drag coefficient by 43.34\%, owing to an extended laminar region on the wing surface, and finds a pressure distribution that strikes a balance between the Tollmien--Schlichting wave and crossflow instability transition mechanisms.}

    abstract    = {With the advent of fast methods to significantly speed up numerical computation of large-scale realistic electromagnetic (EM) structures, EM design and optimization is becoming increasingly attractive. In recent years, genetic algorithms, neural network and evolutionary optimization methods have become increasingly popular for EM optimization. However, these methods are usually associated with a slow convergence bound and, furthermore, may not yield a deterministic optimal solution. In this paper, a new hybrid method using Kriging metamodeling in conjunction with the divided rectangles (DIRECT) global-optimization algorithm is used to yield a globally optimal solution efficiently. The latter yields a deterministic answer with fast convergence bounds and inherits both local and global-optimization properties. Three examples are given to illustrate the applicability of the method, Le., shape optimization for a slot-array frequency-selective surface, antenna location
                  optimization to minimize EM coupling from the antenna to RF devices in automobile structures, and multisensor optimization to satisfy RF coupling constraints on a vehicular chassis in the presence of a wire harness. In the first example, DIRECT with Kriging surrogate modeling was employed. In the latter two examples, the adaptive hybrid optimizer, superEGO, was used. In all three examples, emphasis is placed on the speed of convergence, as well as on the flexibility of the optimization algorithms.}

    abstract    = {Complex engineered systems are typically designed using a systems engineering framework that is showing its limitations. Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO), which has evolved remarkably since its inception 25 years ago, offers alternatives to complement and enhance the systems engineering approach to help address the challenges inherent in the design of complex engineered systems. To gain insight into these challenges, a one-day workshop was organized that gathered 48 people from industry, academia, and government agencies. The goal was to examine MDO's current and future role in designing complex engineered systems. This paper summarizes the views of five distinguished speakers on the ``state of the research'' and discussions from an industry panel comprised of representatives from Boeing, Caterpillar, Ford, NASA Glenn Research Center, and United Technologies Research Center on the ``state of the practice''. Future research topics to advance MDO are also
                  identified in five key areas: (1) modeling and the design space, (2) metrics, objectives, and requirements, (3) coupling in complex engineered systems, (4) dealing with uncertainty, and (5) people and workflow. Finally, five overarching themes are offered to advance MDO practice. First, MDO researchers need to engage disciplines outside of engineering and target opportunities outside of their traditional application areas. Second, MDO problem formulations must evolve to encompass a wider range of design criteria. Third, effective strategies are needed to put designers ``back in the loop'' during MDO. Fourth, the MDO community needs to do a better job of publicizing its successes to improve the ``buy in'' that is needed to advance MDO in academia, industry, and government agencies. Fifth, students and practitioners need to be better educated on systems design, optimization, and MDO methods and tools along with their benefits and drawbacks. }

Airfoil shapes are blended with known analytical section formulae. Generic variable camber wing sections and multicomponent airfoils are generated. For 3D wing definition all parameters are made functions of a third spanwise coordinate. High lift systems are defined kinematically by modelled track gear geometries, translation and rotation in 3D space. Examples for parameter variation in numerical optimization, mechanical adaptation and for unsteady coupling of flow and configuration are presented.}

B-Spline interpolation through a number of points whose coordinates are used as design variables is used to represent airfoil shapes. The advantage of the approach lies in the way these points are defined. The method is particularly useful in shape optimization due to the existence of natural bounds of these parameters. It also eliminates the possibility of crossovers between neighboring points, avoiding the generation of many unrealistic shapes. The ability of the parameterization to model wider range of airfoil profiles is first studied by reproducing many widely used airfoil shapes. In a second study, two optimization problems are formulated which demonstrates the effectiveness of the parameterization method in airfoil optimization problems.

    abstract    = {This is an attempt to clarify and size up the many levels possible for the numerical prediction of a turbulent flow, the target being a complete airplane, turbine, or car. Not all the author's opinions will be accepted, but his hope is to stimulate reflection, discussion, and planning. These levels still range from a solution of the steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations to a Direct Numerical Simulation, with Large-Eddy Simulation in between. However recent years have added intermediate strategies, dubbed ``VLES'', ``URANS'' and ``DES''. They are in experimental use and, although more expensive, threaten complex RANS models especially for bluff-body and similar flows. Turbulence predictions in aerodynamics face two principal challenges: (I) growth and separation of the boundary layer, and (II) momentum transfer after separation. (I) is simpler, but makes very high accuracy demands, and appears to give models of higher complexity little advantage.
                  (II) is now the arena for complex RANS models and the newer strategies, by which time-dependent three-dimensional simulations are the norm even over two-dimensional geometries. In some strategies, grid refinement is aimed at numerical accuracy; in others it is aimed at richer turbulence physics. In some approaches, the empirical constants play a strong role even when the grid is very fine; in others, their role vanishes. For several decades, practical methods will necessarily be RANS, possibly unsteady, or RANS/LES hybrids, pure LES being unaffordable. Their empirical content will remain substantial, and the law of the wall will be particularly resistant. Estimates are offered of the grid resolution needed for the application of each strategy to full-blown aerodynamic calculations, feeding into rough estimates of its feasibility date, based on computing-power growth.}

    abstract    = {This paper presents a methodology for preliminary sizing of unconventional rotorcraft using a physics-based approach to estimate the weight of primary load-carrying members and rotor efficiencies. The methodology is demonstrated for a quadrotor biplane tailsitter, a tilt-body configuration that can operate in both helicopter and airplane mode. A beam lattice framework for the airframe structure is iteratively adjusted in the sizing loop to accommodate the limit loads. A similar semianalytical approach is followed to size and estimate weight of the rotor blades. Using this analysis, a consistent combination of vehicle macrodimensions (rotor radius, wing span) and tip speed as well as detailed design parameters (spar height, skin thickness, and cross-section weight) are obtained simultaneously. To compare the effectiveness of various power plants within a weight class, the sizing methodology was modified to identify the payload for three different vehicle takeoff
                  weights: 20, 50, and 1000 lb. To enable operation within constrained urban canyons, the effect of restricting maximum vehicle dimensions to 10 ftfor the 1000-lb designs is also examined. An electric transmission model is used in these designs owing to its relative insensitivity of transmission efficiency to the operating RPM. A variable-pitch and variable-RPM rotor design allows for control redundancy within each rotor.}

    abstract    = {This paper presents an approach to reframe the sizing problem for vertical-lift unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as an optimization problem and obtains a weight-optimal solution with up to two orders of magnitude of savings in wall clock time. Because sizing is performed with higher fidelity models and design variables from several disciplines, the Simultaneous Analysis aNd Design (SAND) approach from fixed-wing multidisciplinary optimization literature is adapted for the UAV sizing task. Governing equations and disciplinary design variables that are usually self-contained within disciplines (airframe tube sizes, trim variables, and trim equations) are migrated to the sizing optimizer and added as design variables and (in)equality constraints. For sizing consistency, the iterative weight convergence loop is replaced by a coupling variable and associated equality consistency constraint for the sizing optimizer. Cruise airspeed is also added as a design variable and
                  driven by the sizing optimizer. The methodology is demonstrated for sizing a package delivery vehicle (a lift-augment quadrotor biplane tailsitter) with up to 39 design variables and 201 constraints. Gradient-based optimizations were initiated from different starting points; without blade shape design in sizing, all processes converged to the same minimum, indicating that the design space is convex for the chosen bounds, constraints, and objective function. Several optimization schemes were investigated by moving combinations of relevant disciplines (airframe sizing with finite element analysis, vehicle trim, and blade aerodynamic shape design) to the sizing optimizer. The biggest advantage of the SAND strategy is its scope for parallelization, and the inherent ability to drive the design away from regions where disciplinary analyses (e.g., trim) cannot find a solution, obviating the need for ad hoc penalty functions. Even in serial mode, the SAND optimization
                  strategy yields results in the shortest wall clock time compared to all other approaches.}

As Stampede 1 reaches the end of its production life, it is being replaced in phases by a new supercomputer, Stampede 2, that will not only take up much of the original system's workload, but continue the bridge to technologies on the path to exascale computing. This paper provides a brief summary of the experiences of Stampede 1, and details the design and architecture of Stampede 2.

    abstract    = {The paper describes one way to approach the multidisciplinary task of optimizing a tiltrotor wing structure which is equipped with an active flutter suppression system. Objective function is a productivity index, as a measure for aircraft cost-effectiveness. Short digress is held on the characteristics of the tiltrotor's dynamic system and its aeroelastic behavior. Contributing analyses (CA's) for calculating aircraft performance, modeling the dynamic system, and designing an active flutter suppression control system are selected. Multilevel and non-hierarchic decomposition techniques are discussed. A file structure for handling data transfer between the CA's and the optimizer is presented. Preliminary results are shown which highlight some peculiarities of this optimization problem.}

    abstract    = {The use of automated, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to deliver commercial packages is poised to become a new industry, significantly shifting energy use in the freight sector. Here we find the current practical range of multi-copters to be about 4 km with current battery technology, requiring a new network of urban warehouses or waystations as support. We show that, although drones consume less energy per package-km than delivery trucks, the additional warehouse energy required and the longer distances traveled by drones per package greatly increase the life-cycle impacts. Still, in most cases examined, the impacts of package delivery by small drone are lower than ground-based delivery. Results suggest that, if carefully deployed, drone-based delivery could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy use in the freight sector. To realize the environmental benefits of drone delivery, regulators and firms should focus on minimizing extra warehousing and limiting
                  the size of drones.}

    abstract    = {We consider a box-constrained global optimization problem with a Lipschitz-continuous objective function and an unknown Lipschitz constant. The well known derivative-free global-search DIRECT (DIvide a hyper-RECTangle) algorithm performs well solving such problems. However, the efficiency of the DIRECT algorithm deteriorates on problems with many local optima and when the solution with high accuracy is required. To overcome these difficulties different regimes of global and local search are introduced or the algorithm is combined with local optimization. In this paper we investigate a different direction of improvement of the DIRECT algorithm and propose a new strategy for the selection of potentially optimal rectangles, what does not require any additional parameters or local search subroutines. An extensive experimental investigation reveals the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements.}

Although the well-known derivative-free global-search DIRECT algorithm performs well solving box-constrained global optimization problems, it does not naturally address constraints. In this article, we develop a new algorithm DIRECT-GLce for general constrained global optimization problems incorporating two-step selection procedure and penalty function approach in our recent DIRECT-GL algorithm. The proposed algorithm effectively explores hyper-rectangles with infeasible centers which are close to boundaries of feasibility and may cover feasible regions. An extensive experimental investigation revealed the potential of the proposed approach compared with other existing DIRECT-type algorithms for constrained global optimization problems, including important engineering problems.}

This paper shows how the combination of DIRECT and Nelder-Mead algorithms can improve the efficiency in the parameter tuning of a sheet-metal press line. A combined optimisation algorithm is proposed that determines and utilises all local optimal points from DIRECT algorithm as Nelder-Mead starting points. To reduce the total optimisation time, all Nelder-Mead optimisations can be executed in parallel. Additionally, a Collision Inspection Method is implemented in the simulation model to reduce the evaluation time. Altogether, this results in an industrially useful parameter tuning method. Improvements of an increased production rate of 7\% and 40\% smoother robot motions have been achieved.}

    abstract    = {A class of numerical dissipation models for central-difference schemes constructed with second- and fourth-difference terms is considered. The notion of matrix dissipation associated with upwind schemes is used to establish improved shock capturing capability for these models. In addition, conditions are given that guarantee that such dissipation models produce a TVD scheme. Appropriate switches for this type of model to ensure satisfaction of the TVD property are presented. Significant improvements in the accuracy of a central-difference scheme are demonstrated by computing both inviscid and viscous transonic airfoil flows.}

A vortex lattice method is used to evaluate the performance and the time-dependent pressure distribution on the blade surface in a non-uniform flow, while efficient optimization algorithms are used to modify the blade sections. Two different designs were carried out in this study. The first was a design to realize a target pressure distribution in a rotating three-dimensional flow. A two-dimensional wing theory was used to obtain the target pressure distribution. The predicted increase in efficiency and the reduction in the cavity volume were confirmed by model experiments. The second was a design to maximize the propeller efficiency. By this method, the propeller efficiency was improved by 1.2\% under the constrains of constant thrust and a prescribed margin for face cavitation.}

    abstract    = {DIviding RECTangles (DIRECT) is an efficient and popular method in dealing with bound constrained optimization problems. However, DIRECT suffers from dimension curse, since its computational complexity soars when dimension increases. Besides, DIRECT also converges slowly when the objective function is flat. In this paper, we propose a coordinate DIRECT algorithm, which coincides with the spirits of other coordinate update algorithms. We transform the original problem into a series of sub-problems, where only one or several coordinates are selected to optimize and the rest keeps fixed. For each sub-problem, coordinately dividing the feasible domain enjoys low computational burden. Besides, we develop adaptive schemes to keep the efficiency and flexibility to tackle different functions. Specifically, we use block coordinate update, of which the size could be adaptively selected, and we also employ sequential quadratic programming to conduct the local search to
                  efficiently accelerate the convergence even when the objective function is flat. With these techniques, the proposed algorithm achieves promising performance on both efficiency and accuracy in numerical experiments.}

    abstract    = {Traditionally, the design of a transportation system has focused on either vehicle design or the network flow, assuming the other as given. However, to define a system-level architecture for a transportation system, it is advantageous to expand the system boundary during the design process to include the network routing, the vehicle specifications, and the operations that couple the vehicle(s) and the network. In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamental subsystems by classifying the decisions required to define each subsystem. Using an integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation architecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle design and network flow. This is accomplished by embedding a linear programming solver in the perturbation step of simulated annealing to solve for the large number of linear constraints imposed by the capacity and demand requirements of the network.
                  The benefits of this new formulation are illustrated through an example of an air transportation system for an overnight package delivery network in which a 10\% improvement in cost is obtained over traditional network flow optimization. The improvement in system cost obtained can be attributed to the reduction in operational inefficiencies for the transportation system.}

A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and
                  an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.}

    abstract    = {This paper presents a space mapping algorithm for airfoil shape optimization enhanced with adjoint sensitivities. The surrogate-based algorithm utilizes low-cost derivative information obtained through adjoint sensitivities to improve the space mapping matching between a high-fidelity airfoil model, evaluated through expensive CFD simulations, and its fast surrogate. Here, the airfoil surrogate model is constructed though low-fidelity CFD simulations. As a result, the design process can be performed at a low computational cost in terms of the number of high-fidelity CFD simulations. The adjoint sensitivities are also exploited to speed up the surrogate optimization process. Our method is applied to a constrained drag minimization problem in two-dimensional inviscid transonic flow. The problem is solved for several low-fidelity model termination criteria. The results show that when compared with direct gradient-based optimization with adjoint sensitivities, the
                  proposed approach requires 49--78\% less computational cost while still obtaining a comparable airfoil design.}

    abstract    = {The present article deals with recent numerical results from on-going research conducted at ONERA/DMAE regarding the validation of turbulence models for unsteady transonic flows, in which the mechanism of the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction is important. The main goal is to predict the onset and extent of shock induced oscillations (SIO) that appear over the suction side of two-dimensional rigid airfoils and lead to the formation of unsteady separated areas. Computations are performed with the ONERA object-oriented software ``elsA'', using the URANS-type approach. In this approach, the unsteady mean turbulent flow is resolved using the standard Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations and closure relationships involving standard transport equation-type models without any explicit modification due to unsteadiness. Applications are provided and discussed for two different test cases, one of which is rather well documented for CFD validation and described
                  by mean-flow, phase-averaged and fluctuating data. Results demonstrate the importance of modelling the upper and lower walls of the test section when trying to capture SIO as precisely as possible with 2D computations, even though the adaptation of wind tunnel walls had been carefully considered. Finally, turbulence validation has been performed using one- and two-transport equation-type models, one of them resulting from in-house investigations for other turbulent flows applications.}

    abstract    = {Determining the flutter boundaries for full aircraft configurations by time-accurately solving the Reynoldsaveraged Navier-Stokes equations is prohibitive with respect to computational expense, as the unsteady aerodynamic loading must be predicted for a wide range of flight conditions, frequencies, and structural mode shapes. Nonetheless, there is an increasing demand to accurately predict flutter boundaries in the viscous transonic regime-a demand, which, until recently, could only be satisfied by high-fidelity Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes methods. Brought to application readiness over the last years, time-linearized/small-disturbance methods, however, have been shown to satisfy this demand as well. They retain the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes method's fidelity to a high degree, at a substantially reduced computational expense. Such a method is presented here on the basis of the TAU-Reynoldsaveraged Navier-Stokes method. Denoted as the TAU
                  linear-frequency-domain method, it is validated for both a standard transonic airfoil and a high-aspect-ratio-wing dynamic test case using rigid pitch modes. The response data obtained from the linear frequency domain are in good agreement with the experiment for a two-dimensional case. For the three-dimensional case, there are larger differences. More important, the linear-frequency-domain method is in excellent agreement to time-accurate Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations. Depending on the linearfrequency-domain-employed-solution scheme, reductions in computational costs well beyond an order of magnitude are obtained. In addition, the limits of the so-called frozen-eddy-viscosity approach are established. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

This is achieved by extending common AD techniques using operator overloading to take advantage of the fact that in a FEM/FD/FV framework, a limited number of functions and their partial derivatives with respect to the unknowns have to be evaluated many times. The extension is implemented in C++ for both forward and reverse modes, and compared to hand coded evaluation of derivatives and two state-of-the-art AD implementations, ADIC~\cite{Bischof1997A-A} and ADOL-C~\cite{Griewank1996AAP},~\cite{Griewank1996APf}. An application is discussed which dramatically reduces the cost of solver development.}

    abstract    = {In this paper, a compact packing algorithm for the placement of objects inside a container is described. The proposed packing algorithm is designed to pack three-dimensional free-form objects inside an arbitrary enclosure such that the packing efficiency is maximized. The proposed packing algorithm can handle objects with holes or cavities, and its performance does not degrade significantly with the increase in complexity of the enclosure or the objects. The packing algorithm takes as input the tessellated geometry of the container and all the objects to be packed and outputs the list of objects that can be placed inside the enclosure. The packing algorithm also outputs the location and orientation of all the objects, the packing sequence, and the packed configuration. An improved layout algorithm that works with arbitrary container geometry is also proposed. Separate layout algorithms for the SAE and ISO luggage are developed. Several heuristics to improve the
                  performance of the packing algorithm are also incorporated. Certain aspects that facilitate fast and efficient handling of the computer aided design (CAD) data are also discussed. A comprehensive benchmarking of the proposed packing algorithm on synthetic and hypothetical problems reflects its superior performance as compared with other similar approaches. {\textcopyright} 2010 by ASME.}

    abstract    = {One of the most innovative solutions treated in the literature in order to reduce the environmental impact of urban parcel delivery logistics is the use of drones for delivery on the last kilometer. Consequently, nowadays, the primary challenge is essentially related to the drones' fleet sizing according to its means of support for the urban delivery of parcels. In this paper, we will discuss the issue of dimensioning from a forecast of deliveries of an urban perimeter, the size of the fleet, the stock of battery to dispose of and the strategy of battery charging. We will present an analytical model expressing the proposed problem of the optimal drones' delivery mission taking into account the issues of autonomy and energy consumption related to the drone's technical specification. According to the developed analytical model, two optimization policies will be proposed. The first policy consists of planning missions under reducing distance. The second policy tries to
                  make a compromise between the distance and the number of drones. A case study will be presented in order to compare the two policies based on the overall cost of a plan. The main objective of the study is to create a decision-making tool for the design of a drone fleet in the case of forecast deliveries over a time horizon under operational constraints.}

    abstract    = {This paper focuses on the development of a surface mesh movement algorithm suitable for computer-aided-design-based aerodynamic shape optimization. The algorithm interrogates the computer-aided-design system via the vendor-neutral application programming interface Computational Analysis Programming Interface and uses the Computational Analysis Programming Interface's watertight triangulation of a modified computer-aided-design geometry to guide the movement of the structured surface mesh as the geometry changes during the optimization process. A mapping procedure is introduced that not only preserves the characteristics of the original surface mesh but also guarantees that the new mesh points are on the computer-aided-design geometry. The deformed surface mesh is then smoothed in the parametric space before it is transformed back into three-dimensional space. The procedure is efficient, in that all the processing is done in the parametric space, incurring minimal
                  computational cost. The mesh movement tool is integrated into a three-dimensional shape-optimization framework, with a linear-elasticity volume-mesh movement algorithm, a Newton--Krylov flow solver for the Euler equations, and a discrete-adjoint gradient-based optimizer. The accuracy of the computed gradients is verified through a number of examples.}

To this end, we present a dynamic vehicle routing problem with heterogeneous fleets. Customers order goods over the course of the day. These goods are delivered either by a drone or by a regular transportation vehicle within a delivery deadline. Drones are faster, but have a limited capacity as well as require charging after use. In the same-day context, vehicle capacity is not a constraint, but vehicles are slow due to urban traffic. To decide whether an order is delivered by a drone or by a vehicle, we present a policy function approximation based on geographical districting. Our computational study reveals two major implications. First, geographical districting is highly effective increasing the expected number of same-day deliveries. Second, a combination of drone and vehicle fleets may significantly reduce the required delivery
                  resources.}

    abstract    = {Propulsors with boundary layer ingestion (BLI) generate a propulsive force with lower flow power input than conventional engines. This aerodynamic benefit can be traced back to its sources: reductions in jet, surface, and wake dissipation. A framework for BLI analysis is developed based on the power balance method: parametric expressions are derived for the net streamwise force on an aircraft and for the mechanical flow power required, as well as relations for the dissipation components. They illustrate the range of possible comparisons between BLI and non-BLI engine installations, and show how the benefit varies with design choices. Applying the framework to wind tunnel data from powered D8 aircraft model tests, the sources of aerodynamic BLI benefit are quantified for a realistic transport aircraft configuration. With the same propulsors (equal nozzle area) BLI reduces cruise power by 8.2\%, of which 5.2\% comes from a reduction in jet dissipation, 2.4\% from
                  reduced surface dissipation, and 0.6\% from reduced wake dissipation. The jet dissipation reduction is equivalent to a 3.4 percentage points increase in propulsive efficiency. If the installations are compared at equal mass flow, the benefit amounts to a 9\% lower cruise power.}

    abstract    = {The Open/ADF tool allows the evaluation of derivatives of functions defined by a Fortran program. The derivative evaluation is performed by a Fortran code resulting from the analysis and transformation of the original program that defines the function of interest. Open/ADF has been designed with a particular emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and the use of open source components. While the code transformation follows the basic principles of automatic differentiation, the tool implements new algorithmic approaches at various levels, for example, for basic block preaccumulation and call graph reversal. Unlike most other automatic differentiation tools, Open/ADF uses components provided by the Open/AD framework, which supports a comparatively easy extension of the code transformations in a language-independent fashion. It uses code analysis results implemented in the OpenAnalysis component. The interface to the language-independent transformation engine is an
                  XML-based format, specified through an XML schema. The implemented transformation algorithms allow efficient derivative computations using locally optimized cross-country sequences of vertex, edge, and face elimination steps. Specifically, for the generation of adjoint codes, Open/ADF supports various code reversal schemes with hierarchical checkpointing at the subroutine level. As an example from geophysical fluid dynamics, a nonlinear time-dependent scalable, yet simple, barotropic ocean model is considered. OpenAD/F's reverse mode is applied to compute sensitivities of some of the model's transport properties with respect to gridded fields such as bottom topography as independent (control) variables.}

Since that time, the methods have been continually developed and improved, so that today we can say that this technology has matured to become a practical design tool. The purpose here is to review the history of structural optimization and to identify the present state of the art.}

This is not a review of the many technical contributions already reported in a multitude of references. Instead, I will focus on a more general picture of the development and include some stories not well known. Third is a more personal discussion of my career as it has been influenced by Schmit. published in a refereed journal, generated thousands of technical papers and hundreds of professional It is a tribute to Lucien Schmit that his single paper, never jobs and has now matured to the point where practical applications are routine, just at the time when the world is recognizing the importance of conserving resources.}

    abstract    = {This paper presents a new decomposition method for solving large scale multiperiod design problems. These problems are formulated as nonlinear optimization problems with a special block angular structure and linking variables. The proposed method, based on successive quadratic program- ming (SOP). uses a decoupling scheme and projects the orignai problem into a quadratic subproblem involving only the complicating variables. Using this subproblem as the main coordination step the problem in the full space is solved as a stream of independent single period problems. The key property of this method is that the computational effort scales linearly to the number of periods compared to a quadratic and cubic increase for general purpose reduced gradient and SUP methods, repectively. To illustrate this property, the method is applied to four example problems including two in multiperiod chemical process design. Its performance is superior to both MINOS and SQP in terms of
                  computational demands, number of function evaluations and solution robustness.}

Surrogate modeling is often the tool of choice for reducing the computational burden.

This work summarizes advanced and yet simple statistical tools that help. We focus on four techniques with increasing popularity in the design automation community: (i) screening and variable reduction in both the input and the output spaces, (ii) simultaneous use of multiple surrogates, (iii) sequential sampling and optimization, and (iv) conservative estimators.}}

    abstract    = {Surrogate-based optimization proceeds in cycles. Each cycle consists of analyzing a number of designs, fitting a surrogate, performing optimization based on the surrogate, and finally analyzing a candidate solution. Algorithms that use the surrogate uncertainty estimator to guide the selection of the next sampling candidate are readily available, e.g., the efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm. However, adding one single point at a time may not be efficient when the main concern is wall-clock time (rather than number of simulations) and simulations can run in parallel. Also, the need for uncertainty estimates limits EGO-like strategies to surrogates normally implemented with such estimates (e.g., kriging and polynomial response surface). We propose the multiple surrogate efficient global optimization (MSEGO) algorithm, which adds several points per optimization cycle with the help of multiple surrogates. We import uncertainty estimates from one surrogate to
                  another to allow use of surrogates that do not provide them. The approach is tested on three analytic examples for nine basic surrogates including kriging, radial basis neural networks, linear Shepard, and six different instances of support vector regression. We found that MSEGO works well even with imported uncertainty estimates, delivering better results in a fraction of the optimization cycles needed by EGO.}

    abstract    = {Nonlinear programming (NLP) has become an essential tool in process engineering, leading to profit gains through improved plant designs and better control strategies. The rapid advance in computer technology enables engineers to consider increasingly complex systems, where existing optimization codes reach their practical limits. The objective of this dissertation is the design, analysis, implementation, and evaluation of a new NLP algorithm that is able to overcome the current bottlenecks, particularly in the area of process engineering. The proposed algorithm follows an interior point approach, thereby avoiding the combinatorial complexity of identifying the active constraints. Emphasis is laid on flexibility in the computation of search directions, which allows the tailoring of the method to individual applications and is mandatory for the solution of very large problems. In a full-space version the method can be used as general purpose NLP solver, for example in
                  modeling environments such as AMPL. The reduced space version, based on coordinate decomposition, makes it possible to tailor linear algebra work to particular problem structures, such as those arising in dynamic optimization, or even to re-use existing simulation software. If second derivatives are available, they can be exploited explicitly, or otherwise approximated by quasi-Newton methods. In addition, as a compromise between those two options, a conjugate gradient method is implemented for the computation of the tangential step, for which two preconditioners are proposed. This makes the reduced space approach attractive even for problems with many degrees of freedom. Global convergence is enforced by a novel filter line search procedure, which aims to improve efficiency and robustnes over traditional merit function approaches. The discussion of theoretical aspects includes a detailed analysis of a new type of global convergence failure inherent to many current
                  interior point NLP solvers. Global convergence of the filter line search method, introduced to overcome this convergence problem, is proven under mild assumptions. It is further shown that the Maratos effect can be avoided in this framework by second order correction steps, which enables fast local convergence. The practical performance of the proposed method as a general purpose NLP solver is tested on a large variety of NLP test problems. Among the implemented line search methods, the new filter approach seems superior to those based on merit functions. The new optimization code also compares favorably with two other recently developed interior point NLP solvers. The potential of the new method in the area of process engineeing is demonstrated on two dynamic optimization examples with different characteristics, which are solved using orthogonal collocation in a new implementation of the elemental decompositon. Here, the effectiveness of the individual strategies to
                  handle second derivative information is compared. The results confirm that the best choice depends on the particular application. The largest instance addressed is a model with 70 differential and 356 algebraic equations, discretized over 1,500 elements. The resulting NLP with more than 2 million variables and 4,500 degrees of freedom is solved in less than 7 hours on a Linux workstation.}

Hence, the presented approach is especially well suited for equality constrained optimization problems where the Jacobian of the constraints is dense. The accuracy requirements for the presented first-order global convergence result are based on the feasibility and the optimality of the iterates. The corresponding criteria can be verified easily during the optimization process to adjust the approximation quality of the constraint Jacobian.}

Steps computed by direct factorization are always tried first, but if they are deemed ineffective, a trust region iteration that guarantees progress toward stationarity is invoked. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the algorithm is implemented in the Knitro [6, 28] software package and is extensively tested on a wide selection of test problems.}

The spatial discretization consists of a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approach. Implicit time-integration techniques are considered exclusively in order to avoid the stability restrictions of explicit methods. Standard backwards differencing methods (BDF1 and BDF2) as well as a second-order Crank--Nicholson (CN2) and a fourth-order implicit Runge--Kutta (IRK4) scheme are considered in an attempt to balance the spatial and temporal accuracy of the overall approach. The implicit system arising at each time step is solved using a p-multigrid approach, which is shown to produce h independent convergence rates, while remaining relatively insensitive to the time-step size. The Crank--Nicholson methodology, although not L-stable, demonstrates superior performance compared to the BDF2 scheme
                  for the problems chosen in this work. However, the fourth-order accurate implicit Runge--Kutta scheme is found to be the most efficient in terms of computational cost for a given accuracy level as compared to the lower-order schemes, in spite of the added cost per time step, and the benefits of this scheme increase for tighter error tolerances.}

    abstract    = {The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based reduced-order model (ROM) has been an effective tool for flow field prediction in the engineering industry. The sample selection in the design space for POD basis construction affects the ROM performance sensitively. Adaptive sampling can significantly reduce the number of samples to achieve the required model accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive sampling algorithm, called conjunction sampling strategy, which is based on proven strategies. The conjunction sampling strategy is demonstrated on airfoil flow field prediction within the transonic regime. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed strategy by running 10 trials for each strategy for the robustness tests. Results show that the conjunction sampling strategy consistently achieves higher predictive accuracy compared with Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and existing strategies. Specifically, under the same computational budget (40 training samples
                  in total), the conjunction strategy reduced the L2 error by 56.7\% compared with LHS. In addition, the conjunction strategy reduced the standard deviation of L2 errors by 62.1\% with a 2.6\% increase on the mean error compared with the best existing strategy.}

    abstract    = {An inverse method for reconstruction of the in situ steady-state hydrodynamic load distribution using limited strain measurements is developed and validated on a rectangular, flexible surface-piercing hydrofoil in fully-wetted (FW) and fully-ventilated (FV) flows. The hydrofoil is used as a canonical proxy to more complex hydrodynamic lifting surfaces such as marine propulsors and turbines. The approach involves using a forward fluid--structure interaction (FSI) model to predict the hydroelastic response for given operating conditions. The inverse problem is solved as an optimization problem to determine unknown operating conditions. The forward FSI model consists of a nonlinear lifting line (LL) fluid solver with considerations for free surface, ventilation, and viscous effects, and a solid finite element method (FEM) solver using 1-D beam elements representing the spanwise bending and twisting deformations. The coupled FSI model was validated using data collected
                  during towing tank experiments at the University of Michigan. Predictions of the lift and moment coefficients, as well as spanwise bending and twisting deformations agreed well with experimental results in FW and in FV flows. The inverse problem is formulated as an optimization problem to determine the unknown operating conditions that will minimize the difference between the measured and predicted deformations. To avoid non-uniqueness problems often encountered by inverse problems, a dynamic constraint using the measured wetted natural frequencies was added to help regularize the problem and speed up the solution process. A sequential quadratic programming algorithm was used as the optimizer for the inverse problem. The experimental studies showed that the inverse FSI model accurately determined the unknown operating conditions (angle of attack and immersed aspect ratio) for a given a known flow speed and a limited number of strain measurements in both FW and FV
                  conditions. The converged results were used to reconstruct a 3-D hydrodynamic load distribution on the foil and to predict the cavity shape for FV operating conditions, which were found to agree well with experimental measurements and observations.}

The values of subsystem inputs are, however, coordinated in the second level, instead of being adjusted in the first level, as in previous methods. As a result, in contrast with previous methods, the sub- problems in the first level include a small number of variables to be adjusted; in addition, the generalized Lagrangian is decomposable in a simple manner. Further, the decomposition is not subject to any restriction, which is often encountered in feasible methods.}

It was created for rapid conceptual aircraft design and advanced technology impact assessments. FLOPS is a single computer program that includes weights estimation, aerodynamics estimation, engine cycle analysis, propulsion data scaling and interpolation, detailed mission performance analysis, takeoff and landing performance analysis, noise footprint estimation, and cost analysis. It is well known as a baseline and common denominator for aircraft design studies. FLOPS is capable of calibrating a model to known aircraft data, making it useful for new aircraft and modifications to existing aircraft. The weight estimation method in FLOPS is known to be of high fidelity for conventional tube with wing aircraft and a substantial amount of effort went into its development. This report serves as a comprehensive documentation of the FLOPS
                  weight estimation method. The development process is presented with the weight estimation process.}

The chain itself involves an unstructuredmesh Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes solver, and is suitable for the optimization of complex geometries in three dimensions. In addition to the discrete flow adjoint the method introduces a second ad- joint equation for the mesh deformation. Using the adjoint chain it is possible to evaluate the gradients of a cost function for the cost of one adjoint flow solution and one adjoint volume mesh deformation, without performing any (forward) mesh deformation. By choos- ing a suitable mesh deformation operator, like linear elasticity, the chain may be readily constructed by hand. Furthermore, this adjoint chain can be subsequently used with pa- rameterized surface grids. The accuracy and the computational savings of the resulting procedure is examined for the gradient-based shape optimization of a wing in inviscid
                  flow.}

    abstract    = {As in the first and second editions, the book revolves around the fact that turbulence modeling is one of three key elements in CFD. Very precise mathematical theories have evolved for the other two, viz., grid generation and algorithm development. By its nature, i.e., creating a mathematical model that approximates the physical behavior of turbulent flows, far less precision has been achieved in turbulence modeling. This text addresses the problem of selecting/devising such models. The fundamental premise is, in the spirit of G. I. Taylor, an ideal model should introduce the minimum amount of complexity while capturing the essence of the relevant physics. The text begins with the simplest models and charts a course leading to some of the most complex models that have been applied to a nontrivial flow. Along the way, a systematic methodology is presented for developing and analyzing turbulence models. The methodology makes use of tensor calculus, similarity
                  solutions, singular perturbation methods, and numerical procedures. The text stresses the need to achieve a balance amongst the physics of turbulence, mathematical tools required to solve turbulence-model equations, and common numerical problems attending their use (i.e., what good is a model if it makes your program crash?). Several user friendly programs and detailed user's guides are provided on the Compact Disk that accompanies the text. Many of the applications are used throughout the text to permit comparison of complicated models with simpler models. A completely objective point of view is taken in assessing the merits of models and their range of applicability. The text includes an extensive Bibliography, a detailed Index and well thought out homework problems of varying degrees of difficulty.}

These discontinuities arise when (partial) differential equations are discretized using non-constant methods and the resulting numerical solutions are used in com- puting the objective function. Although the functions may become discontinuous, gradient information may be computed at every point. Gradient information is computable everywhere since every point has an associ- ated discretization for which (semi) analytical sensitiv- ities can be calculated. Rather than the construction of global approximations using only function value infor- mation to overcome the discontinuities, we propose to use only the gradient information. We elaborate on the modifications of classical gradient based optimization algorithms for use in gradient-only approaches, and we then present gradient-only optimization strategies using both BFGS and a new spherical quadratic ap- proximation for
                  sequential approximate optimization (SAO). We then use the BFGS and SAO algorithms to solve three problems of practical interest, both un- constrained and constrained.}

    abstract    = {The increasing usage of low-Reynolds-number (10,000--100,000 tip Reynolds number) scale quadrotors for civilian and military applications provides the impetus for the development of reliable design methodologies. At present, there is limited understanding of how to accurately size quadrotor components for a specific mission. These components include the rotors, motors, speed controllers, batteries, and airframe. However, empirical relationships may be derived for these components based on manufacturer data. The present research identifies the key factors driving vehicle weight and provides a framework for implementing these factors in a micro air vehicle design tool. Starting from basic rotor parameters (such as radius, solidity, and airfoil section) and an initial gross takeoff weight estimate, a blade element momentum theory framework coupled with computational-fluid-dynamics-generated sectional airfoil tables provides an acceptable estimate of low-Reynolds-number
                  rotor power and torque for required thrust. The aerodynamic power and torque along with desired flight time and speed drive the weights of the quadrotor components. The proposed sizing tool has been validated against a series of existing quadrotors with 30--1000 g gross takeoff weights. Current results show that individual weight groups can be predicted generally within a $\pm$10\% deviation and the gross takeoff weight of each vehicle is predicted within a $\pm$4\% variation.}

    abstract    = {The majority of industrial computational fluid dynamics simulations are steady. Such simulations therefore require numerical methods which can rapidly converge a boundary value problem, typically either the Euler or Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations. In this chapter we outline two major approaches: time-marching methods built on top of Runge--Kutta time-stepping schemes and Newton--Krylov methods. A range of techniques for accelerating convergence are presented including local time-stepping, enthalpy damping, residual averaging, multigrid methods and preconditioning. More recent hybrid approaches such as the Runge--Kutta symmetric Gauss--Seidel are also discussed. The effectiveness of these methodologies, within the context of several Euler and RANS test cases, is also evaluated.}

As optimization problems increase in size, however, certain standard techniques for smaller problems become inappropriate because of excessive requirements of time and/or storage. Furthermore, some approaches regarded as uncompetitive for small problems re-emerge as useful alternatives when problems become sufficiently large. Specialized high-performance computer architectures complicate the picture even more with respect to both viable linear algebraic sub-problems and algorithmic strategies. This paper will briefly discuss selected topics in large-scale optimization, with particular stress on issues associated with very expensive function evaluations.}

The code is MPI-wrapped to enable execution of expensive parallel analyses and gradient evaluations, such as when using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which can require hundreds of processors. The optimization history can be stored in a database file, which can then be used both for post-processing and restarting another optimization. A graphical user interface application is provided to visualize the optimization history interactively.}

However, current multifidelity approaches cannot handle the high-dimensional problems commonly encountered in industrial settings. Furthermore, they cannot accommodate arbitrary analysis fidelities, directly handle multidisciplinary problems, or provably converge to the high-fidelity optimum. In this paper, we present a practical multifidelity approach that leverages the advantages of conventional gradient-based approaches. Rather than constructing a multifidelity surrogate, we perform a sequence of single-fidelity gradient-based optimizations. The framework determines the appropriate fidelity and updates it during the optimization process. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed approach on a multipoint aerostructural wing optimization problem with over a hundred design variables. The
                  multifidelity approach reduces the computational cost by 59\% compared to the high-fidelity approach while obtaining the same numerical optimum.}

    abstract    = {A set of implicit methods are proposed for a third-order hierarchical WENO reconstructed discontinuous Galerkin method for compressible flows on 3D hybrid grids. An attractive feature in these methods are the application of the Jacobian matrix based on the P1 element approximation, resulting in a huge reduction of memory requirement compared with DG (P2). Also, three approaches --- analytical derivation, divided differencing, and automatic differentiation (AD) are presented to construct the Jacobian matrix respectively, where the AD approach shows the best robustness. A variety of compressible flow problems are computed to demonstrate the fast convergence property of the implemented flow solver. Furthermore, an SPMD (single program, multiple data) programming paradigm based on MPI is proposed to achieve parallelism. The numerical results on complex geometries indicate that this low-storage implicit method can provide a viable and attractive DG solution for
                  complicated flows of practical importance.}

    abstract    = {Abstract Metamodels are widely used to facilitate the analysis and optimization of engineering systems that involve computationally expensive simulations. Kriging is a metamodelling technique that is well known for its ability to build surrogate models of responses with non-linear behaviour. However, the assumption of a stationary covariance structure underlying Kriging does not hold in situations where the level of smoothness of a response varies significantly. Although non-stationary Gaussian process models have been studied for years in statistics and geostatistics communities, this has largely been for physical experimental data in relatively low dimensions. In this paper, the non-stationary covariance structure is incorporated into Kriging modelling for computer simulations. To represent the non-stationary covariance structure, we adopt a non-linear mapping approach based on parameterized density functions. To avoid over-parameterizing for the high dimension
                  problems typical of engineering design, we propose a modified version of the non-linear map approach, with a sparser, yet flexible, parameterization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through both mathematical and engineering examples. The robustness of the method is verified by testing multiple functions under various sampling settings. We also demonstrate that our method is effective in quantifying prediction uncertainty associated with the use of metamodels. Copyright {\copyright} 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

    abstract    = {Over the past decades significant progress has been made with adjoint computational fluid dynamics solvers, which are an essential part of efficient high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimisation. Shape parametrisation is much less mature, in particular the field is lacking efficient and automatic CAD-based parametrisation methods. The paper proposes a novel CAD-based parametrisation with CAD in the design loop such that the CAD shape can ultimately serve as a datum surface in multi-disciplinary optimisation. Wing and fuselage are modelled with B-spline surfaces. The intersection line is calculated using an in-house implementation of a B-spline surface modeller and its derivative is efficiently calculated via finite differences. The proposed parametrisation method is applied to the redesign of the wing--fuselage junction of the DLR-F6 model using an adjoint solver based on Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations. The moving intersection line capability enables the
                  fuselage surface to be deformed and the resulting intersection line to move along the fixed wing during optimisation. The flow separation in the wing--body junction is substantially suppressed by an improved fuselage shape, at the cost of O(10) steady-state flow and adjoint solutions. The proposed parametrisation method represents an important step towards automated CAD-based optimisation for fully-featured aircraft characterised by complex intersecting surfaces.}

The proposed methods are exterior point type methods that permit primal variables to violate inequality constraints during the iterations. The methods are based on the exact penalty type transformation of inequality constraints and use a smooth approximation of the problem to form primal-dual iteration based on Newton's method as in usual primal-dual interior point methods. Global convergence and local superlinear/quadratic convergence of the proposed methods are proved. For global convergence, methods using line searches and trust region type searches are proposed. The trust region type method is tested with CUTEr problems and is shown to have similar efficiency to the primal-dual interior point method code IPOPT. It is also shown that the methods can be warm started easily, unlike interior point methods, and that the methods can be efficiently used in parametric
                  programming problems.}

Special fitness function as well as modified total lift--drag ratio is discussed in detail. Turbine performance tests and flow visualization experiments by PIV are conducted in order to draw a comparison between the optimized and two other competitive hydrofoils. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimized is more suitable to marine condition and beneficial to turbine efficiency improvement, and can be expected to act as a prospective hydrofoil for helical vertical axis turbine.}

The study was done on two different layups, [({\^A}$\pm$30)3/902]s and [({\^A}$\pm$45)2/O2/902]s. Out-of-plane moir{\~A}{\copyright} interferometry and diiodomethane-enhanced X-radiography were used to detect delamination. A strength criterion for the onset of delaminatoin is proposed and an assessment made of the effect of matrix properties on delamination onset. A modified energy release rate model is presented for characterization of delamination growth emphasis being placed on assessing the behavior of delamination resistance curves and delamination growth rate. The results indicate that enhancement of matrix strength and ductility increases the critical loads for delamination onset and delamination
                  resistance in the composite laminates under static loading, and significantly reduces the delamination growth rate under cyclic loading.}

Unfortunately, these methods perform poorly during the initial stages of convergence, particularly for three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes simulations. Addressing this problem requires the use of a globalization method such as pseudo-transient continuation, along with an approximate Newton--Krylov startup stage. This class of methods marches the solution in pseudo-time with a matrix-based approximate Jacobian that has a lower bandwidth and better conditioning properties compared with the exact Jacobian. However, this matrix-based approach also has shortcomings, including a large cost of computing and storing the approximate Jacobian and its preconditioner, along with the need for an updated Jacobian for every nonlinear iteration. To rectify these shortcomings, we use herein approximate residual
                  formulations in a Jacobian-free approximate Newton--Krylov algorithm. With the approximate Jacobian, we compute the vector products by using the approximate residual computations in a matrix-free manner while forming a preconditioner based on the matrix-based approximate Jacobian. This approach keeps the approximate Jacobian up to date and mitigates the cost of forming a matrix-based Jacobian and its preconditioner at each iteration by lagging the preconditioner between nonlinear iterations. We use varying levels of approximations with the matrix-free approach and thereby demonstrate the trade-off between rate of convergence and the cost of each nonlinear iteration. The proposed implementation uses only the exact and approximate residual formulations and can therefore be generalized with minimal additional implementation effort to a range of solvers and various discretizations. The code is available under an open-source license.}

    abstract    = {Boundary layer ingestion (BLI) offers the potential for significant fuel burn reduction by exploiting strong aeropropulsive interactions. NASA's STARC-ABL concept uses an electrically powered BLI tail cone thruster on what is otherwise a conventional airframe. Despite this conventional airframe, aeropropulsive integration is critical to the performance of the BLI propulsor. In particular, the aeropropulsive integration of the BLI system must account for the variation in fan performance. Because it is electrically powered, the fan pressure ratio and efficiency of the BLI tail cone thruster vary widely across the flight envelope. Thus, accurate performance prediction for this novel propulsion configuration requires using a coupled aeropropulsive model across the flight envelope. In this work, we introduce a method to quantify the benefit of BLI at off-design conditions. We analyze the off-design performance of 18 optimized designs using an aeropropulsive model that is
                  built with the OpenMDAO framework to couple 3-D RANS CFD simulations to 1-D thermodynamic cycle analyses. The designs are generated via high-fidelity aeropropulsive design optimizations for a range of fan pressure ratio and thrust values at the cruise conditions for the STARC-ABL concept. Performance analyses are then performed at a range of off-design flight conditions that span the flight envelope, including low-speed and low-altitude flight conditions. This study provides the first set of high-fidelity data for the STARC--ABL configuration at off-design conditions. The results quantify the power savings through BLI compared to a traditional propulsion system across the entire mission profile. Finally, the results and techniques from this study will guide the extension of current aeropropulsive design capabilities to multipoint design optimizations.}

    abstract    = {Aerodynamic shape optimization based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) requires three steps: updating the geometry based on the design variables, updating the CFD surface mesh for the new geometry, and updating the CFD volume mesh based on the new surface mesh. While there are many tools available for the first and third steps, the methods available for the second step are insufficient for geometries that have intersecting components. For these geometries, the CFD surface mesh needs to be updated near component intersections to conform to the component geometries and the updated intersection curves. To address this need, we introduce a method that can deform the CFD surface mesh nodes near component intersections. The method can handle arbitrary design changes for each intersecting component as long as the geometric topology is unchanged. Furthermore, the method is suitable for gradient-based optimization because it smoothly deforms every CFD surface node without
                  introducing topological changes in the CFD surface mesh. In this paper, we detail each step of the proposed method and visualize the range of design changes that can be achieved with this approach. Finally, we use the proposed method in an aerodynamic shape optimization problem to optimize the wing-body intersection of the DLR-F6 configuration. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a high-fidelity design optimization framework. The method applies to both structured and unstructured CFD meshes and makes it possible to use computer-aided design and conceptual design geometry tools within high-fidelity design optimization.}

With the evolution of highperformance computing resources such as Intel's Knights Landing and Skylake architectures in the Stampede2 cluster, CFD solver performance can be improved by modifying how the core computations are performed while keeping the mathematical formulation unchanged. In this work, we introduce a cache-blocking method to improve memory-bound CFD codes that use structured grids. The overall idea is to split computational blocks into smaller, fixed-sized blockettes that are sufficiently small to completely fit into the available cache size for each core on a given architecture. We can fully take advantage of modern vector instruction sets such as AVX2 and AVX512 on these modern architectures with this approach. Using this method, we have achieved up to 3.27 times speedup in the core
                  routines of the open-source CFD solver, ADflow.}

    abstract    = {Design and integration of advanced propulsion systems play a critical role in the development of environmentally sustainable aircraft. Even though these advanced technologies, such as boundary layer ingestion, offer significant aeropropulsive benefits, their design is challenging due to the tightly coupled nature of these systems, as well as the lack of previous experience with their design. Aeropropulsive design optimization offers a promising solution to these design problems where coupled models are used to maximize the aeropropulsive benefits of these propulsion systems. Despite its advantages, the use of aeropropulsive design optimization has been limited due to the shortcomings in robustness of existing design optimization approaches. In this work, we address several key shortcomings in existing design optimization approaches and introduce robust methods for aeropropulsive design optimization. Some of these developments target the shortcomings in CFD-based
                  design optimization such as geometric parameterization and CFD solver robustness, while the rest of the developments focus on coupled aeropropulsive model development and optimization. Using all of these developments, we performed a series of coupled aeropropulsive design optimizations to quantify the benefit of boundary layer ingestion to the STARC-ABL concept. This first of a kind design study was enabled by the robustness of the overall aeropropulsive design framework we developed herein and will be useful for guiding future design studies of boundary layer ingesting propulsion systems. The robust methods presented in this thesis are crucial for future CFD-based design optimization problems, including aeropropulsive design optimization. These advancements bring us closer to using the ever-growing power of scientific computing in the process of designing future environmentally sustainable aircraft.}

    abstract    = {Boundary-layer ingestion (BLI) offers the potential for significant fuel burn reduction by exploiting tightly coupled aeropropulsive effects. NASA's Single-aisle Turboelectric Aircraft with Aft Boundary-Layer propulsion (STARC-ABL) concept employs BLI on an electrically powered tail cone thruster to take advantage of the technology on what is otherwise a conventional airframe. Despite the traditional airframe of this concept, aeropropulsive integration is critical to the BLI propulsor's performance. Therefore, it is vital to employ tightly coupled aeropropulsive models to design BLI systems. In this work, 3-D RANS simulations are used to model the aerodynamics, and 1-D thermodynamic cycle analyses are used to model the propulsion system. The two models are tightly coupled using NASA's OpenMDAO framework, enabling efficient design optimization through gradient-based optimization with analytic derivatives. Using this coupled aeropropulsive framework, 18 computational
                  fluid dynamics (CFD)-based aeropropulsive design optimizations are performed to study the power requirements of the BLI configuration and a reference podded configuration where the electric fan ingests freestream air. This study provides the first set of CFD-based performance data for the STARC-ABL concept across the design space of BLI fan size and pressure ratio. The results quantify the power savings through BLI compared to a traditional propulsion system.}

    abstract    = {Aerodynamic shape optimization is a useful tool in wing design, but the impact of the choice of optimization algorithm and the multimodality of the design space in wing design optimization is still poorly understood. To address this, we benchmark both gradient-based and gradient-free optimization algorithms for computational fluid dynamics based aerodynamic shape optimization problems based on the Common Research Model wing geometry. The aerodynamic model solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations with a Spalart--Allmaras turbulence model. The drag coefficient is minimized subject to lift, pitching moment, and geometry constraints, with up to 720 shape variables and 11 twist variables for two mesh sizes. We benchmark six gradient-based and three gradient-free algorithms by comparing both the accuracy of the optima and the computational cost. Most of the optimizers reach similar optima, but the gradient-based methods converge to more accurate solutions at a
                  much lower computational cost. Since multimodality and nonsmoothness of the design space are common arguments for the use of gradient-free methods, we investigate these issues by solving the same optimization problem starting from a series of randomly generated initial geometries, as well as a wing based on the NACA 0012 airfoil with zero twist and constant thickness-to-chord ratio. All the optimizations consistently converge to practically identical results, where the differences in drag are within 0.05\%, and the shapes and pressure distributions are very similar. Our overall conclusion is that the design space for wing design optimization with a fixed planform is largely convex, with a very small flat region that is multimodal because of numerical errors. However, this region is so small, and the differences in drag so minor, that the design space can be considered unimodal for all practical purposes.}

The framework is utilized to design a 10 MW rotor constrained not to exceed the design loads of an existing reference wind turbine. The results show that through combined geometric tailoring of the internal structure and aerodynamic shape of the blade it is possible to achieve significant passive load alleviation that allows for a 9\% longer blade with an increase in AEP of 8.7\%, without increasing blade mass and without significant increases in ultimate and fatigue loads on the hub and tower.}

A logic threshold control strategy (LTCS) implemented in an existing hybrid vehicle was considered. A set of parameters was adopted in the LTCS to command the operation of the vehicle. The optimal adjustment of these parameters was formulated as a constrained nonlinear programming problem with an objective function minimizing fuel consumption. A DIRECT algorithm was proposed and applied to find the optimal set of parameters. Simulation results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method which can be used for off-line parametric optimization and thus shorten the time of controller calibration in the real vehicle.}

    abstract    = {Parametric modeling of aircrafts plays a crucial role in the aerodynamic design process. Effective parametric approaches have large design space with a few variables. Parametric methods that commonly used nowadays are summarized in this paper, and their principles have been introduced briefly. Two-dimensional parametric methods include B-Spline method, Class/Shape function transformation method, Parametric Section method, Hicks-Henne method and Singular Value Decomposition method, and all of them have wide application in the design of the airfoil. This survey made a comparison among them to find out their abilities in the design of the airfoil, and the results show that the Singular Value Decomposition method has the best parametric accuracy. The development of three-dimensional parametric methods is limited, and the most popular one is the Free-form deformation method. Those methods extended from two-dimensional parametric methods have promising prospect in aircraft
                  modeling. Since different parametric methods differ in their characteristics, real design process needs flexible choice among them to adapt to subsequent optimization procedure.}

This paper provides a uniform framework to facilitate understanding different drone energy consumption models and the inter-relationships between key factors and performance measures to facilitate decision making for drone delivery operations. We review, classify and assess drone energy consumption models. We then document the very wide variations in the modeled energy consumption rates resulting from differences in: (1) the scopes and features of the models; (2) the specific designs of the drones; and (3) the details of their assumed operations and uses. The results show that great care must be taken in adopting a particular drone energy consumption model and that more research is needed, especially empirical research, to ensure the selected model accurately reflects delivery drone designs and
                  uses.}

    abstract    = { AbstractComputer simulations often involve both qualitative and numerical inputs. Existing Gaussian process (GP) methods for handling this mainly assume a different response surface for each combination of levels of the qualitative factors and relate them via a multiresponse cross-covariance matrix. We introduce a substantially different approach that maps each qualitative factor to underlying numerical latent variables (LVs), with the mapped values estimated similarly to the other correlation parameters, and then uses any standard GP covariance function for numerical variables. This provides a parsimonious GP parameterization that treats qualitative factors the same as numerical variables and views them as affecting the response via similar physical mechanisms. This has strong physical justification, as the effects of a qualitative factor in any physics-based simulation model must always be due to some underlying numerical variables. Even when the underlying
                  variables are many, sufficient dimension reduction arguments imply that their effects can be represented by a low-dimensional LV. This conjecture is supported by the superior predictive performance observed across a variety of examples. Moreover, the mapped LVs provide substantial insight into the nature and effects of the qualitative factors. Supplementary materials for the article are available online.}

Finding such optimal designs is a strongly nonlinear problem. In slider ABS optimization, the evaluation of the objective function for every sample design takes substantial computation time. It is desirable to reduce the number of sample designs evaluated without losing the global property of the optimization algorithm. In this paper, the DIRECT (DIviding RECTangle) optimization technique, which is a deterministic global optimization technique, was applied to slider ABS optimization. Results show that the DIRECT algorithm has a very fast convergence rate and it outperforms the adaptive simulated annealing algorithm.}

We prove global convergence to a station- ary point of the infinite-dimensional problem. Moreover, we illustrate how the adaptive refinement strategy of the algorithm can be implemented by using existing reliable a posteriori error estimators for the state and the adjoint equations. Numerical results are presented.}
